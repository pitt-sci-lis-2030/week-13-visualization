"Nikiforova A., McBride K.",Open government data portal usability: A user-centred usability analysis of 41 open government data portals,2021,Telematics and Informatics,,"University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia; Hertie School Centre for Digital Governance, Berlin, Germany","Open government data, as a phenomena, may be considered an important and influential innovation that has the potential to drive the creation of public value via enabling the prevention of corruption, increase in accountability and transparency, and driving the co-creation of new and innovative services. However, in order for open government data to be fully taken advantage of, it must be found, understood, and used. Though many countries maintain open government data portals, the usability of said portals can vary greatly; this is important to understand as the usability of a portal likely impacts the eventual reuse of the data made available there. Acknowledging the importance of portal usability to the data reuse process, this paper helps to elucidate some initial insights by asking two questions: “How can the usability of open government data portals be evaluated and compared across contexts?” and “What are the most commonly missing usability aspects from open government data portals?”. In order to answer these research questions, a subset of 41 national open government data portals were selected for an in-depth usability analysis drawing on the feedback from 40 individual users. As a result of this analysis, the paper is able to make three primary contributions: (1) the validation of a framework for open government data portal usability analysis, (2) develops an initial comparative international ranking of open government data portal usability, and (3) identifies commonly occurring portal usability strengths and weaknesses across contexts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Open data; Open data portal; Open government data; Usability,Digital storage; Government data processing; Usability engineering; Co-creation; Data portal; Data reuse; Primary contribution; Public values; Research questions; Usability analysis; User-centred; Open Data,"Nikiforova, A.; University of LatviaLatvia; email: Anastasija.nikiforova@lu.lv",English,Article,Final,Scopus
"Wilson B., Cong C.",Beyond the supply side: Use and impact of municipal open data in the U.S,2021,Telematics and Informatics,,"Urban and Environmental Planning, School of Architecture, University of Virginia, 110 Bayly Dr, Charlottesville, VA  22903, United States; Department of Urban and Regional Planning, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 611 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL  61820, United States","While the number of open government data initiatives has increased considerably over the past decade, the impact of these initiatives remains uncertain. Recent studies have been critical of the “bias toward the supply side” and lack of “sufficient attention to the user perspective” in the way that open government data initiatives are implemented. This article asks: (1) who is using municipal open government data resources and for what purposes? and (2) what impact are municipal open government data having in cities where they have been implemented? We performed a qualitative analysis of 26 semi-structured telephone interviews conducted with government staff, civic technologists, and private sector stakeholders in nine cities around the United States. Each of these 30 to 45-minute telephone interviews were transcribed and analyzed to distill insights regarding the use and impact of municipal open government data in the nine cities considered. We find that the array of actors within open government data ecosystems at the local level is expanding as distinctions between the public and private sectors becomes increasingly blurred and that the demands of managing and sustaining these initiatives has led to changes in the services offered by local government, as well as in the duties of government staff. The impact of these data resources has been primarily felt within local government itself, although the lack of monitoring mechanisms makes it difficult to systematically evaluate their broader effects. We conclude that open government data initiatives should be coordinated and better integrated with digital equity and digital inclusion efforts in order to advance their political and social goals. © 2020 The Author(s)",Civic technology; Digital equity; Local government; Open data,Government data processing; Service industry; Telecommunication industry; Telephone sets; Digital inclusion; Government staff; Local government; Monitoring mechanisms; Public and private sector; Qualitative analysis; Semi-structured; User perspectives; Open Data,"Wilson, B.; Urban and Environmental Planning, 110 Bayly Dr, United States; email: bw6xs@virginia.edu",English,Article,Final,Scopus

In this study data from Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) and Open Government Data Platform India (OGDPI) on food-borne outbreaks for the period 2008–2018 was consolidated and analysed. The modelling methods of Gaussian distribution model (GAM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were used to probe influence of climatic factors (temperature and rainfall) on food-borne outbreaks. Data analysis showed that states of West Bengal (31.22), Karnataka (29.11) and Gujarat (22.67) reported maximum average outbreaks and contributed to 31.5% illnesses and 8.7% deaths. Amongst 19.6% of outbreaks, grains and beans were found to be food-vehicle causing maximum outbreaks (32.7%), while chemically contaminated food caused maximal deaths (70%). Weak correlations of climatic factors with outbreaks resulted in poor performance of ARIMA models. GAM model was validated and predicted 356 outbreaks for the year 2020, late-April to mid-July being most prevalent months. The analysis also revealed inclination of current surveillance program towards chemically contaminated food that resulted in maximal deaths (70%), while biological agents were observed to be under-reported. Despite the limitations, available data shows that food-borne disease outbreaks remain a public health concern in India. Therefore, it is imperative for India to strengthen its disease surveillance program by undertaking capacity-building initiatives at state/local health-care levels and connecting causative agents of outbreaks. This would help in efficient implementation of risk assessment and risk management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Food-borne disease; IDSP; India; Outbreaks; Surveillance,,"Taneja, N.K.; Department of Basic and Applied Science, India; email: neetu.taneja@niftem.ac.in",English,Article,Final,Scopus
"Golub K., Lund A.",Why open government data? The case of a Swedish municipality,2021,Journal of Data and Information Science,,"Linnaeus University, Växjö, 351 95, Sweden; Södertörn University, Huddinge, Stockholm, 141 89, Sweden","Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to provide modern local governments with potential use cases for their open data, in order to help inform related future policies and decision-making. The concrete context was that of the Växjö municipality located in southeastern Sweden. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology was two-fold: 1) a survey of potential end users (n=151) from a local university; and, 2) analysis of survey results using a theoretical model regarding local strategies for implementing open government data. Findings: Most datasets predicted to be useful were on: sustainability and environment; preschool and school; municipality and politics. The use context given is primarily research and development, informing policies and decision making; but also education, informing personal choices, informing citizens and creating services based on open data. Not the least, the need for educating target user groups on data literacy emerged. A tentative pattern comprising a technical perspective on open data and a social perspective on open government was identified. Research limitations: In line with available funding, the nature of the study was exploratory and implemented as an anonymous web-based survey of employees and students at the local university. Further research involving (qualitative) surveys with all stakeholders would allow for creating a more complete picture of the matter. Practical implications: The study determines potential use cases and use contexts for open government data, in order to help inform related future policies and decision-making. Originality/value: Modern local governments, and especially in Sweden, are faced with a challenge of how to make their data open, how to learn about which types of data will be most relevant for their end users and what will be different societal purposes. The paper contributes to knowledge that modern local governments can resort to when it comes to attitudes of local citizens to open government data in the context of an open government data perspective. © 2021 Sciendo.

We conducted a two-year design study focused on the creation of a community-based data display using the United States Environmental Protection Agency data on water permit violations by oil storage facilities on the Chelsea Creek in Massachusetts to explore whether situated data physicalization and Participatory Action Research could support meaningful engagement with open data. We selected this data as it is of interest to local groups and available online, yet remains largely invisible and inaccessible to the Chelsea community. The resulting installation, Chemicals in the Creek, responds to the call for community-engaged visualization processes and provides an application of situated methods of data representation. It proposes event-centered and power-aware modes of engagement using contextual and embodied data representations. The design of Chemicals in the Creek is grounded in interactive workshops and we analyze it through event observation, interviews, and community outcomes. We reflect on the role of community engaged research in the Information Visualization community relative to recent conversations on new approaches to design studies and evaluation. © 2020 IEEE.",data physicalization; environmental HCl; Participatory Action Research; water quality,Chemicals; Data visualization; Digital storage; Environmental Protection Agency; Information systems; Power management; Visualization; Community-based; Data representations; Design studies; Information visualization; Oil storage facilities; Participatory action research; United States environmental protection agency; Visualization process; Open Data,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

How do they affect trust in European countries?,2021,Journal of Data and Information Science,,"San Antonio Catholic University of Murcia, Faculty of Law and Business Administration, Avda. de los Jerónimos, 135, Murcia, 30107, Spain","Purpose: This paper aims to assess if the extent of openness and the coverage of data sets released by European governments have a significant impact on citizen trust in public institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Data for openness and coverage have been collected from the Open Data Inventory 2018 (ODIN), by Open Data Watch; institutional trust is built up as a formative construct based on the European Social Survey (ESS), Round 9. The relations between the open government data features and trust have been tested on the basis of structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The paper reveals that as European governments improve data openness, disaggregation, and time coverage, people tend to trust them more. However, the size of the effect is still small and, comparatively, data coverage effect on citizens’ confidence is more than twice than the impact of openness. Research limitations: This paper analyzes the causal effect of Open Government Data (OGD) features captured in a certain moment of time. In upcoming years, as OGD is implemented and a more consistent effect on people is expected, time series analysis will provide with a deeper insight. Practical implications: Public officers should continue working in the development of a technological framework that contributes to make OGD truly open. They should improve the added value of the increasing amount of open data currently available in order to boost internal and external innovations valuable both for public agencies and citizens. Originality/value: In a field of knowledge with little quantitative empirical evidence, this paper provides updated support for the positive effect of OGD strategies and it also points out areas of improvement in terms of the value that citizens can get from OGD coverage and openness. © 2021 Sciendo.

The index, which weighs different open government dimensions, is built for a sample of 33 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (oecd) from open and consistent sources. The results show that the areas of transparency and open data have a wide room for improvement and that participation and collaboration strategies require an autonomous approach.

Policies on open government data (OGD) inspire the development of new and innovative services that government agencies may lack. The International Open Data Charter adequately describes the importance of data mining. Governments that have signed this charter should focus on the following areas—(i) data mining, (ii) linkage, and (iii) in-depth analysis, i.e., distribution of open data that is freely accessible for elaborate analysis using machine reading. However, a series of practical difficulties is observed in connection with the data mining of OGD for in-depth analysis. First, most OGD do not have identifiers to prevent privacy disclosure. Second, owing to the nature of siloed data, the data sharing and collection methods vary with respect to heterogeneous OGD, and administrative or institutional barriers need to be overcome. This has created a demand for a novel technical solution that applies micro-aggregation and distance-based record linkage to address the aforementioned issues. Thus, in this study, a method capable of integrating two or more de-identified OGDs into one dataset to enable OGD data mining is proposed. In addition, the proposed method allows users to adjust the privacy threshold level to determine an appropriate balance between privacy disclosure risk and data utility. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated in terms of several metrics via extensive experimentation. This study emphasizes the importance of the research on efficient utilization of already-published OGDs, which has been relatively neglected in the past. Further, it broadens the research area for privacy-preserving data mining by proposing a method capable of mining heterogeneous data even in the absence of identifiers. © 2020 The Author(s)",Heterogeneous data sources; Machine learning; Micro-aggregation; Open government data; Privacy-preserving data mining; Synthetic data; Unsupervised learning,,"Jun, S.-P.; Data Analysis Platform Center, 66, Hoegi-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, South Korea; email: spjun@kisti.re.kr",English,Article,Final,Scopus
Kassen M.,Understanding motivations of citizens to reuse open data: open government data as a philanthropic movement,2021,Innovation: Organization and Management,,"Graduate School of Public Policy, Nazarbayev University, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan","The purpose of the article is to understand the socioeconomic conditions and driving forces that facilitate and motivate civic developers to reuse open data and create their own data-driven services, often on a free of charge, i.e., philanthropic basis. The recent emergence of myriad independent civic open data-driven projects in many parts of the world promise to propose new participatory ways to meet the needs of local communities and find cost-effective solutions to various issues at local levels of governance such as better urban planning, improvement of public transportation routes, crime rates mapping, assessment of public services, public scrutiny of lobbying activity, etc. However, the competitive market in the e-commerce sector often leaves little economic niches for independent civic developers to hope for big revenues from the promotion of such projects, especially considering the fact that the vast majority of them are implemented at local levels and their target audiences are usually small to ensure even economic self-sustainability. In this regard, the purpose of the paper is to understand what motivates civic developers, who often call themselves technically savvy citizens or independent developers, to step in and begin to reuse open data, which is published by local governments, considering that the creation of such data-driven projects is time and money consuming business, and, more importantly, elaborate on what kind of challenges these civic stakeholders face on the way. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",citizens; motivations; Open data; open government; philanthropy; social democracy,,"Kassen, M.; Graduate School of Public Policy, Kazakhstan; email: maka.mca2@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Government officials who are charged with implementing this new policy usually need to look for related information for deciding what datasets to open to the public. Accordingly, a research gap exists in understanding government officials' information behaviors in implementing open data policy. By using a qualitative approach to conduct semi-structured interviews with government officials who have extensive experience in implementing open data policy, this study explores government officials' information behaviors in searching and selecting datasets for open data publication. Specifically, this research investigates government officials' information needs, the employed information sources, and the intervening variables that influence their information behaviors. While open data is an ongoing policy implementation, government officials' information behaviors form an iterative cycle where information needs continually occur, information seeking activities are conducted by using a variety of information sources, and the obtained information is used to satisfy information needs.

Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews of open government have been limited. This research gap not only impedes our understanding of the overall body of knowledge on open government but also hinders the advancement of existing practices. To address this gap, this article systematically reviews 189 studies published from 2008 to 2019. Guiding this review are the central research questions: (1) How has the concept of open government been defined and conceptualized in the literature? (2) How is open government being used and implemented? (3) What outcomes or impacts are attributed to open government initiatives? This research found that open government is generally conceptualized as a new governing structure emphasizing both transparency (vision) and public participation (voice). However, it also identifies a “transparency-driven focus” for both the case selection of academic studies and practical implementation, which represents a gap between open government theory and practice. This research also reveals the lack of empirical evidence regarding the effects of open government and highlights methodological concerns of prior studies. The article concludes with a discussion on future research. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Open government; Open government data; PRISMA; Systematic review; Transparency,,,English,Article,Article in Press,Scopus

In a context of a global trust crisis in the European Union, this paper examines if open government data, a promising governance strategy, may help to boost Millennials’ and Generation Z trust in public institutions and satisfaction with public outcomes. First, results from our preliminary analysis challenge some popular beliefs by revealing that younger generations tend to trust in their institutions notably more than the rest of the European citizens. In addition, our findings show that open government data is a trust-enabler for Millennials and Generation Z, not only through a direct link between both, but also thanks to the mediator role of citizens’ satisfaction. Accordingly, public officers are encouraged to spread the implementation of open data strategies as a way to improve younger generations’ attachment to democratic institutions.

Governments world-wide continue to implement these platforms, aiming to increase transparency and accountability. However, in spite of their positive intentions, ODGPs that provide performance data (e.g. about schools or hospitals) are reported to create serious harmful social effects. While the related literature has reported numerous cases of these unintended effects, the questions regarding why and how they emerge remain open. This is not surprising, given the complexity and dynamics of processes instigated through the use of ODGPs by a very large number of known and unknowable actors. Through a diffractive reading of complexity theories, in particular Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and sociomateriality, in this paper we propose a Complex Adaptive Sociomaterial Systems (CASS) theorization of OGDPs. Drawing from a case of OGDP in Australia called My School, which provides open performance data for more than 10.000 schools, we demonstrate how the proposed theoretical lens of CASS enables us to reveal and explain why and how these platforms perform unintended, yet serious social harm. Given that OGDPs are rapidly emerging around the world, our research opens a pathway for a research-informed public discourse about their harmful effects and responsibilities of different stakeholders. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Complex adaptive sociomaterial systems; Complex adaptive systems; Harmful social effects; Open data platforms; Open government data platforms, open performance data; Sociomateriality",,"Marjanovic, O.; School of Professional Practice & Leadership, Building 11, Room 11.10.213, PO Box 123, Australia; email: olivera.marjanovic@uts.edu.au",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change. © 2020 Milojevic-Dupont et al.

In Brazil, the information-access law contributes to public administration transparency, as public data is available on the Web. However, such data are in different formats and not standardized, which makes it difficult to obtain information, mainly in an automated way. Hence, this work presents an enrichment methodology for an existing open Brazilian judiciary database, a characterization of the available data, and an analysis of the data about judiciary professionals and their earns. The results reveal a lack of linear correlations between the high salaries and their personal benefits. Also, there is a discrepancy between Judiciary salaries and advantages through Brazilian regions, which may be explained by the higher living costs in some regions. Finally, our study reveals the administrative Brazilian Judiciary data do not conform to all Open Government Data principles, and the enriched database helps to solve such problems. © 2020 ACM.",content processing; data analysis; open data,Open Data; Transparency; Wages; Democratic process; Information access; Linear correlation; Public data; Public administration,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

FD is an initiative of the Open Knowledge Foundation, which aims to eliminate ""friction"" in working with data, that is, when much time and resources are lost to understand and work with the data. Within public institutions, the lack of standards for publication and processing of DAGs is a common problem when it comes to opening DAGs. The study tried to contribute by applying the model to the set of data with information on good practices executed by the Judiciary related to the Objectives of Sustainable Development (ODS). Through a bibliographic survey, the main characteristics found in the models for opening DOGS and barriers inherent to the publication process, were identified in the literature. The laboratory research technique was used to describe and analyze the application of the proposed model in a controlled environment for specific purposes of this work. The model was based on Data Publication Workflow, a data publication flow available at the Frictionless Data initiative website that addresses steps such as data packaging, treatment and publication. The implementation of the model also used open source tools based on Frictionless Data. The results showed the feasibility of the model for opening up a set of open government data, as well as demonstrated that the tools available in the Frictionless Data initiative contributed to the verification of the steps in the model. It was concluded that the model needs validation in other contexts, such as integration and opening of different public databases related to ODS. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

What explains these cross-country differences? Adopting an interdisciplinary approach based on data science and economic theory, we developed the following research workflow. First, we gather, clean, and merge different datasets released by institutions such as the Open Knowledge Foundation, World Bank, United Nations, World Economic Forum, Transparency International, Economist Intelligence Unit, and International Telecommunication Union. Then, we conduct feature extraction and variable selection founded on economic domain knowledge. Next, we perform several linear regression models, testing whether cross-country differences in the supply of open government data can be explained by differences in the country’s economic, social, and institutional structures. Our analysis provides evidence that the country’s civil liberties, government transparency, quality of democracy, efficiency of government intervention, economies of scale in the provision of public goods, and the size of the economy are statistically significant to explain the cross-country differences in the supply of open government data. Our analysis also suggests that political participation, sociodemographic characteristics, and demographic and global income distribution dummies do not help to explain the country’s supply of open government data. In summary, we show that cross-country differences in governance, social institutions, and the size of the economy can explain the global distribution of open government data. © 2020 by the authors.

It is one of the primary principles of open data, which is considered to be a success factor, while at the same time it is one 0f the biggest barriers that can disrupt users trust in data and even the desire to use the entire open data portal. However, assessing this aspect is a very difficult task that, in most cases, becomes an impossible for open data users. There is therefore a lack of comparative studies on the timeliness of data of different national open data portals. Unfortunately, 2020 gave the opportunity to find out this. It became easy enough to compare how long is the data path from the data holder to the OGD portal by analysing the timeliness of Covid-19-re1ated data sets in relation to the first case observed in a country. The study thus fills the gap of comparative studies by addressing 60 countries and their OGD portals concerning the timeliness of the data, providing a report on how much and what countries provide the open data as quickly as possible. It makes it possible to understand how quickly OGD portals react to emergencies by opening and updating data for their further potential reuse, which is essential in the digital data-driven world. © 2020 IEEE.",Covid-19; frequency of updates; open data; open government data; pandemic; portal; timeliness,Government data processing; Comparative studies; Data paths; Data portal; Data users; Digital datas; Success factors; Open Data,"Nikiforova, A.; University of Latvia Riga, Latvia; email: Anastasija.Nikiforova@lu.lv",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The ultimate focus of developing these sustainable systems is to provide citizens with transparency, accountability, awareness as well as a single point of query for asking integrated and smart queries. In view of these benefits, the Saudi government has taken the initiative to publish and develop sustainable open data-oriented information systems. However some major challenges in the Saudi Government Open Data are that the (1) data are published and available in different formats such as Excel sheets, CSV files (Comma Separated Values), images, scanned documents and social media sources such as Twitter, (2) datasets from different government departments are not linked with each other or to existing datasets in Linked Open Data Cloud (even though they have strong links with each other), and (3) there is no SPARQL Endpoint that can be used to pose smart semantic-based queries to Saudi Government Data. This paper is part of an ongoing research project to present a framework that can be used to transfer the government data from different sources to RDF format. The framework can also be used to clean and classify/map the data according to the Saudi Government Ontology. We also describe our approach for semiautomatically linking Saudi Government Datasets with one another as well as with other existing open datasets, thus resulting in the Saudi Linked Open Government Data Cloud (SLOGDC). Finally, taking the topic “Public’s Response to Women’s Driving in Saudi Arabia” as a case study, we demonstrate the SLOGD SPARQL Endpoint as a data-oriented system by executing different queries and analyzing results of these queries. This work also contributes new insights into women’s driving in Saudi Arabia using the SLOGDC, thus suggesting the way forward in shaping policies for decision-making. © 2020 by the authors.

One explanation is that public trust may respond more positively to a kind of “latent transparency” in which citizens highly value the mere potential for open access to government information, even if they may have more negative reactions when presented with the particular content of actual government information, documents, or data. To test this hypothesis, we designed two survey experiments in which samples of US adults were primed with general information about the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or the existence of open government data. Compared to controls, we find that awareness of FOIA rights and requirements (latent transparency) tended to be unrelated, or even slightly negatively related, to trust of government agencies, contrary to our expectations. Our findings, combined with prior evidence, suggest that—even in the case of latent transparency—the popular belief in transparency's positive effects on citizen trust needs a more critical examination.

As such, the institutional environment and their behavior towards the opening of data is key to increase the quality and quantity of open data. However, few studies have analyzed the behavior of government professionals towards open data policy. The objective of this paper is to review the existing literature to find the factors that influences civil servants behaviors towards open data. To identify the drivers and barriers, a literature review was performed listing the most cited papers with ""open government data""and ""barriers""focusing specific at the behavioral related factors. Even with the increasing of research on the topic of open data, still most of the papers focus on user drivers and barriers rather than on provider challenges. Even less studies focus on the civil servants' individual level of factors influencing their support to the release of governmental data. Most barriers found in the literature are related to infrastructural or technical issues. Whereas some individual level behavioral barriers could be found, including culture, lack of individual incentives and misunderstanding the impact of opening data, broader discussions on social norms, lack of education and experience are still missing in the literature.

"Konstantinou N., Paton N.W.",Feedback driven improvement of data preparation pipelines,2020,Information Systems,2,"Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, United Kingdom","Data preparation, whether for populating enterprise data warehouses or as a precursor to more exploratory analyses, is recognised as being laborious, and as a result is a barrier to cost-effective data analysis. Several steps that recur within data preparation pipelines are amenable to automation, but it seems important that automated decisions can be refined in the light of user feedback on data products. There has been significant work on how individual data preparation steps can be refined in the light of feedback. This paper goes further, by proposing an approach in which feedback on the correctness of values in a data product can be used to revise the results of diverse data preparation components. The approach uses statistical techniques, both in determining which actions should be applied to refine the data preparation process and to identify the values on which it would be most useful to obtain further feedback. The approach has been implemented to refine the results of matching, mapping and data repair components in the VADA data preparation system, and is evaluated using deep web and open government data sets from the real estate domain. The experiments have shown how the approach enables feedback to be assimilated effectively for use with individual data preparation components, and furthermore that synergies result from applying the feedback to several data preparation components. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Data preparation; Data wrangling; Dataspace; Extract transform load; Feedback,Cost effectiveness; Data warehouses; Feedback; Cost effective; Data preparation; Data space; Data wrangling; Enterprise data warehouse; Exploratory analysis; Extract transform loads; Statistical techniques; Pipelines,"Paton, N.W.; Department of Computer Science, Oxford Road, United Kingdom; email: norman.paton@manchester.ac.uk",English,Article,Final,Scopus
"Linåker J., Runeson P.",Public Sector Platforms going Open: Creating and Growing an Ecosystem with Open Collaborative Development,2020,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,"Department of Computer Science, Lund University Lund, Sweden","Background: By creating ecosystems around platforms of Open Source Software (OSS) and Open Data (OD), and adopting open collaborative development practices, platform providers may exploit open innovation benefits. However, adopting such practices in a traditionally closed organization is a maturity process that we hypothesize cannot be undergone without friction. Objective: This study aims to investigate what challenges may occur for a newly-turned platform provider in the public sector, aiming to adopt open collaborative practices to create an ecosystem around the development of the underpinning platform. Method: An exploratory case-study is conducted at a Swedish public sector platform provider, which is creating an ecosystem around OSS and OD, related to the labor market. Data is collected through interviews, document studies, and prolonged engagement. Results: Findings highlight a fear among developers of being publicly questioned for their work, as they represent a government agency undergoing constant scrutiny. Issue trackers, roadmaps, and development processes are generally closed, while multiple channels are used for communication, causing internal and external confusion. Some developers are reluctant to communicate externally as they believe it interferes with their work. Lack of health metrics limits possibilities to follow ecosystem growth and for actors to make investment decisions. Further, an autonomous team structure is reported to complicate internal communication and enforcement of the common vision, as well as collaboration. A set of interventions for addressing the challenges are proposed, based on related work. Conclusions: We conclude that several cultural, organizational, and process-related challenges may reside, and by understanding these early on, platform providers can be preemptive in their work of building healthy ecosystems. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Collaborative Development; Ecosystem; Open Government Data; Open Source Software,Ecosystems; Investments; Open source software; Open systems; Collaborative development; Collaborative practices; Development process; Exploratory case studies; Government agencies; Internal communications; Investment decisions; Multiple channels; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The governments of various countries have encouraged firms to adopt OGD to develop innovative products and services to bring about social and economic benefits. This paper examines the factors influencing the adoption of OGD among firms in Taiwan to fill a gap that prior studies do not adequately address. Based on the sociotechnical perspective, we developed a research model that integrates the following factors that are central to adoption decisions of firms: top management support, government support, competitive pressure, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We examined this model through survey data from firms with experience in OGD adoption in Taiwan. The results show a significant positive relationship among top management support, competitive pressure, and the adoption of OGD by firms. This paper serves as a first attempt to contribute to advancing knowledge on OGD adoption at the firm level via empirically testing a research model that integrates factors within social and technical systems. This paper has significant implications for practitioners of enterprise information management and creates a valuable reference for other countries in the early stages of OGD initiatives. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Competitive pressure; government support; open government data (OGD) adoption; perceived barriers; perceived benefits; sociotechnical perspective; top management support,Government data processing; Information management; Competitive pressure; Government supports; open government data (OGD) adoption; perceived barriers; Perceived benefits; Socio-technical perspective; Top management support; Open Data,"Wang, H.-J.; Department of Management, Taiwan; email: hjwang@gm.fgu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,Scopus

We propose Open Data Collaboration (ODC) to describe pecuniary and non-pecuniary sharing of open data, similar to Open Source Software (OSS) and in contrast to Open Government Data (OGD), where public authorities share data. To understand challenges and opportunities with ODC, we organized five focus groups with in total 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. In the discussions, we observed a general interest in the subject, both from private companies and public authorities. We also noticed similarities in attitudes to open innovation practices, i.e. initial resistance which gradually turned into interest.

The main goal of this study is to understand how firms use open government data to create value. More specifically, we aim to identify what types of use are currently in place and which industries are more prominent in exploiting open government data. Building on the analysis of a dataset of 178 firms that use open government data across various industries in the U.S. we find twelve different atomic models. Additionally, our findings suggest that the way in which open government is used to create value is contingent to the firms' activities.

Evidence from a cross-country study,2020,Government Information Quarterly,,"School of Government and Public Policy, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow 16 Richmond St, Glasgow, G1 1XQ, United Kingdom","In election times, political parties promise in their manifestos to pass reforms increasing access to government information to root out corruption and improve public service delivery. Scholars have already offered several fascinating explanations of why governments adopt transparency policies that constrain their choices. However, knowledge of their impacts is limited. Does greater access to information deliver on its promises as an anti-corruption policy? While some research has already addressed this question in relation to freedom of information laws, the emergence of new digital technologies enabled new policies, such as open government data. Its effects on corruption remain empirically underexplored due to its novelty and a lack of measurements. In this article, I provide the first empirical study of the relationship between open government data, relative to FOI laws, and corruption. I propose a theoretical framework, which specifies conditions necessary for FOI laws and open government data to affect corruption levels, and I test it on a novel cross-country dataset. The results suggest that the effects of open government data on corruption are conditional upon the quality of media and internet freedom. Moreover, other factors, such as free and fair elections, independent and accountable judiciary, or economic development, are far more critical for tackling corruption than increasing access to information. These findings are important for policies. In particular, digital transparency reforms will not yield results in the anti-corruption fight unless robust provisions safeguarding media and internet freedom complement them. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",accountability; corruption; cross-country analysis; freedom of information; media and internet freedom; open government data; transparency,,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

We employ a comparative case study of open government data platforms in three leading Latin American cities and draw upon the concept of boundary resources taken from platform theory. Our research generates two key contributions. First, we propose a theoretical model, which explains how an OGD platform owner is able to govern the demand and the supply side of its platform to facilitate the cultivation of a platform ecosystem.

Although previous research gives insight into citizen’s drivers and inhibitors for engaging with OGD, they have not yet been integrated into a single conceptual model. The aims of this study are twofold: 1) to systematically review the literature on individual citizens’ drivers and inhibitors for engaging with OGD and 2) to develop a conceptual model of citizen engagement with OGD based on the findings of the literature review. To attain this objective, the authors systematically analyzed 52 papers published in the period 2009-2019. Seven categories of drivers of citizen engagement are identified: citizen’s profile, personal, performance-related, economic, social, technical, and political. Three groups of inhibitors are also identified: citizen’s profile, technical, and political. This study helps in understanding how the engagement of citizens can be enhanced.

Despite its potential benefits, OGD has not been widely and successfully adopted in public sector organizations, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the theories/frameworks and potential determinants that influence the OGD adoption in public sector organizations. To ascertain the various determinants of OGD adoption in public sector organizations, this study involved a systematic review of already established theories and determinants addressed in the public sector open data domain. The review revealed that the TOE (technology, organization, environment) framework was dominantly employed over theories in the earlier studies to understand organizational adoption to OGD followed by institutional theory. The results, concerning potential determinants, revealed that some of the most frequently addressed determinants are an organization's digitization/digitalization capacity, compliance pressure, financial resources, legislation, policy, regulations, organizational culture, political leadership commitment, top-management support, and data quality. The findings will enrich researchers to empirically investigate the exposed determinants and improve the understanding of decision-makers to leverage OGD adoption by taking relevant measures. © 2020 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

The work is driven by open government data (OGD) that has been increasingly used by data consumers which motivates a proliferation of software applications for the civilians. As the number of government open data portals increases, the decision on which portal to use often relies on the portal with the most relevant content. Nevertheless, even though the relevant portals are known, data consumers are still left with the question of whether the sources in hand subscribe to open data quality standards. This is because the quality of the data source will affect decision making. Manual checking is feasible, but it is not an attractive option as the number of data sources grows. Thus, in this article, we present the results of implementing open data portals selection with quality consideration. The enhancement of the ACO algorithm is made through quality filters. OGD policies from 30 Open Government Data (OGD) Portals are retrieved to establish the set of data quality requirements that are used in the filtering process. The model considers three selection parameters to assess 40 random countries. The parameters are quality requirements coverage in the OGD policy, the readiness aspect of the OGD portal, and the content of government data. The implementation of this model gives an insight into how the ACO algorithm can be used to deal with selection problem that involves multi-sources and multi-selection criteria. The results of this paper contribute to improving the quality of data provided by OGD providers for open data consumers. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

This “disintermediation” of (i.e., greater direct access to) public information may improve transparency and facilitate citizen engagement, but it may also overwhelm citizens not only with too much information but also by requiring them to take responsibility for gathering, assembling, and processing information. Despite the importance of effective information processing to successful use of available information, existing studies have not yet fully integrated this consideration into research on citizen use of e-government and open government data. Based on information processing theory—according to which individuals have a finite information processing capacity, which is affected not only by the quantity and quality of information but also by one's preferences for how information is presented—this study examined the effects of information presentation type (infographic versus text) on perceived information overload, along with the consequent effect of information overload on perceived website usefulness. We also investigated whether individual information processing propensity (visual or verbal) moderated the effect of information presentation type on perceived information overload. Our results showed that textual information tended to cause greater information overload, especially for those with a propensity for visual information processing, and that higher information overload was associated with a lower perception of website usefulness. Moreover, individual information propensity moderated the effect of information type on perceived information overload; people with visual information processing propensity were more strongly affected by the presentation of textual information.

Although some governments actively respond to such changes, others are found to lag despite these pressures. This study focuses on the political and administrative factors in explaining this variation. Examining how Korean local governments responded to citizens' open data requests during 2007-2016, the study demonstrates how political competition and administrative capacity are critical factors for improving government transparency and responsiveness to information disclosure requests from citizens. Specifically, considering (1) the scope of information disclosure, (2) the time to disclosure, and (3) the quality of disclosed information as the outcomes, greater electoral competition and stronger administrative capacity were found to help governments enhance transparency and responsiveness. However, regression discontinuity design shows that the partisan affiliation of local governments had little significant impact on these outcomes. © 2020 ACM.",Electoral competition; Open government data; Transparency,Government data processing; Transparency; Critical factors; Data requests; Electoral competitions; Information disclosure; Local government; Political competition; Social norm; Technological development; Open Data,"Hong, S.; Department of Public Administration, South Korea; email: sounman_hong@yonsei.ac.kr",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

However, studies that empirically test this assumption are scarce. Using the Information Systems (IS) Success Model as a theoretical basis, this study aims to examine the effects of data quality, system quality, and service quality on citizens' trust in OGD. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the 200 responses to our online questionnaire. We found that trust in OGD can be predicted by citizens' perceptions of OGD system quality and service quality. Furthermore, citizens' perception of service quality positively influences their perceptions of data and system quality, whereas citizens' perception of system quality positively influences their perception of data quality. This study is among the first that quantitatively examines the effects of data quality, service quality, and system quality on citizen's trust in OGD. It contributes to the scientific literature by providing an operationalization of elements of the IS Success Model in the context of OGD and by developing and applying a model of factors influencing citizen's trust in OGD. While previous research finds that perceived data quality is the most crucial driver for trust in OGD, our study finds that citizens' perception of OGD service quality is a more important driver for trust in OGD. With regard to the practical contributions of this study, open data policymakers should be aware that citizens' perceptions on data quality can be greatly improved when appropriate human services are provided (e.g., designated civil servants offering support or help to data users) in addition to the provision of OGD portal functionalities (e.g., data visualization and comparison tools). © 2020 ACM.",Citizen engagement; Data quality; Information Systems Success Model; Open Government Data; Service quality; Structural Equation Modeling; Systems quality; Trust,Data reduction; Data visualization; Government data processing; Information use; Quality of service; Civil servants; Information systems success models; IS success model; Online questionnaire; Scientific literature; Service Quality; Structural equation modeling; System quality; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

From an innovation perspective, we explore the current gap between the promise and practice of open government data. Based on Strategic Niche Management (SNM), we identify different phases in the open data innovation process. This study uses a living lab in a province in the Netherlands to stimulate the provision and use of open data for collaborative processes and analyses the mechanisms that condition the success of this innovation process. The results based on six interventions over a period of two years show that our interventions stimulated the use of open data and raised awareness within government, but that various mechanisms inhibited the realization of the ambitions of open government data. We conclude that the challenge of open government data as an innovation lies in finding a way to scale up the provision of open data: innovation niches are established but “regime changes” do not take place. Scaling up open government data use requires strong managerial commitment and changes in the wider organizational landscape such as constructing formal and informal rules and technological developments that stimulate debate about open data practices. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Digital government literature attempts to bridge these elements. The Window Theory is introduced, in order to unify existing models by integrating a broad range of factors within a single model. The Window Theory can be used to develop context-dependent models that are both comprehensive and parsimonious. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Almost undisputed, the concept has gained importance in both academic and practitioners’ circles due to its strong intrinsic and/or instrumental value. Recent years have seen the emergence of the open-data movement and its growing impact on government policies. Nevertheless, evidence related to impacts on transparency remains fragmented. This study aims to contribute to the field of research on transparency and open data by providing a conceptual clarification and by showing how both concepts are related and perceived in the Swiss public administration. This allows avoiding further confusion and better understanding the relation between the two notions. Moreover, this contribution also explores the implementation of the open-data logic in Switzerland. Although it does not participate in the Open Government Partnership, an international platform of 75 governments committed to making their activities more transparent, the country launched the federal Open Government Data project in 2015 with the aim of establishing an open-data culture within the administration. However, implementation of the open-data logic has been rather halting so far. Based on in-depth interviews conducted with civil servants in Switzerland, this contribution identifies four main types of barriers that impact on the uptake of open data in Switzerland: cultural, institutional, individual and economic. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",administrative reforms; open data; open government; Switzerland; transparency,,"Mabillard, V.; Swiss Graduate School of Public Administration (IDHEAP), Switzerland; email: vincent.mabillard@unil.ch",English,Article,Final,Scopus

In the context of coordinating multiple stakeholders, the role of the local government can be defined as ‘meta-governance’. It shall provide rules to facilitate collective action and co-produce quality public services. However, the case of Wuhan suggests that some local governments still rely on the traditional administrative system, which hampers them in terms of issuing a sufficient response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Three measures can be taken to facilitate a public governance mechanism in public health emergency management. First, local governments can use the ICTs to create a more transparent information mechanism. The free flow of information could alert all stakeholders to potential emergencies, while the open government data form the base for cross-border collaboration. Second, a more comprehensive Public Health Emergency Preparedness is constructive for local governments in making quality and immediate decisions. This preparedness shall clearly define the responsibility of the involved agencies based on a careful evaluation of their qualification and capability. Third, the local government shall note that good governance requires more than an executive capacity based on command-and-control.

We argue that open government data are a strategic resource of organizations and therefore organizations are not likely to share it. We develop an analytical framework for studying the politics of open government data, based on theories of strategic responses to institutional processes, government transparency, and open government data. The framework shows that there can be different organizational strategic responses to open data—varying from conformity to active resistance—and that different institutional antecedents influence these responses. The value of the framework is explored in two cases: a province in the Netherlands and a municipality in France. The cases provide insights into why governments might release datasets in certain policy domains but not in others thereby producing “strategically opaque transparency.” The article concludes that the politics of open government data framework helps us understand open data practices in relation to broader institutional pressures that influence government transparency. © The Author(s) 2019.",Open government data; organizational strategic responses; politics; transparency,,"Ruijer, E.; Utrecht UniversityNetherlands; email: h.j.m.ruijer@uu.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Although these studies help to clarify the adopter's decision, the stance of the adopter after accepting the OGD is very much important. Knowing the limited availability of the literature about OGD in the post-adoption phase, this study seeks to propose a research model for OGD implementation in the post-adoption phase in Malaysia's public sector. The research model is drawn from the Technology-Organization-Environment framework and innovation adoption process as the theoretical foundation, while the OGD principles are integrated as an added construct to the research model.

Open government data platforms are aimed at enhancing transparency and participation. Even though the promises of these platforms are high, their full potential has not yet been reached. Scholars have identified technical and quality barriers of open data usage. Although useful, these issues fail to acknowledge that the meaning of open data also depends on the context and people involved. In this study we analyze open data usage from a practice lens – as a social construction that emerges over time in interaction with governments and users in a specific context – to enhance our understanding of the role of context and agency in the development of open data platforms. This study is based on innovative action-based research in which civil servants’ and citizens’ initiatives collaborate to find solutions for public problems using an open data platform. It provides an insider perspective of Open Data Work. The findings show that an absence of a shared cognitive framework for understanding open data and a lack of high-quality datasets can prevent processes of collaborative learning. Our contextual approach stresses the need for open data practices that work on the basis of rich interactions with users rather than government-centric implementations. © The Author(s) 2018.",citizen participation; e-government; open government; open government data; transparency,citizenship; data set; Internet; local government; local participation; numerical model; policy implementation,"Ruijer, E.; Utrecht University School of GovernanceNetherlands; email: h.j.m.ruijer@uu.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The tasks for the city administration have become more complex, whereas tools and methods are often based on traditional, static approaches while involving a limited number of citizens and stakeholders in relevant decisions. The digital transformation of more and more pieces of the planning and decision-making process will make both increasingly more illustrative, easier to understand and more comprehensible. An important data basis for these processes is the digital twin of the City of Zurich. 3D spatial data and their models transform themes of the city, such as buildings, bridges, vegetation, etc., to the digital world, are being updated when required, and create advantages in digital space. These benefits need to be highlighted and published. An important step in public awareness is the release of 3D spatial data under Open Government Data. This allows the development of applications, the promotion of understanding, and the simplification of the creation of different collaborative platforms. By visualization and analysis of digital prototypes and the demonstration of interactions with the built environment, scenarios can be digitally developed and discussed in decision-making bodies. Questions about the urban climate can be simulated with the help of the digital twin and results can be linked to the existing 3D spatial data. Thus, the 3D spatial data set, the models and their descriptions through metadata become the reference and must be updated according to the requirements. Depending on requirements and questions, further 3D spatial data must be added.

OGD is becoming a major source for knowledge and innovation to generate economic value, if properly used. However, currently there are no standards or frameworks for applying knowledge continuum tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to improve elicit knowledge extraction from OGD in a consistent manner. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a comprehensive review of literature on both OGD and knowledge management (KM) frameworks. It provides insights into the extraction of knowledge from OGD by using a vast array of phased KM TTPs into the OGD lifecycle phases. Findings: The paper proposes a knowledge iterative value network (KIVN) as a new conceptual model that applies the principles of KM on OGD.

However, not much is known regarding how this type of engagement emerges. This study aims to investigate the necessary conditions for the emergence of citizen-led engagement with OGD and to identify which factors stimulate this type of engagement. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors created a systematic overview of the literature to develop a conceptual model of conditions and factors of OGD citizen engagement at the societal, organizational and individual level. Second, the authors used the conceptual model to systematically study citizens’ engagement in the case of a particular OGD initiative, namely, the digitization of presidential election results data in Indonesia in 2014. The authors used multiple information sources, including interviews and documents, to explore the conditions and factors of OGD citizen-led engagement in this case. Findings: From the literature the authors identified five conditions for the emergence of OGD citizen-led engagement as follows: the availability of a legal and political framework that grants a mandate to open up government data, sufficient budgetary resources allocated for OGD provision, the availability of OGD feedback mechanisms, citizens’ perceived ease of engagement and motivated citizens. In the literature, the authors found six factors contributing to OGD engagement as follows: democratic culture, the availability of supporting institutional arrangements, the technical factors of OGD provision, the availability of citizens’ resources, the influence of social relationships and citizens’ perceived data quality. Some of these conditions and factors were found to be less important in the studied case, namely, citizens’ perceived ease of engagement and citizens’ perceived data quality. Moreover, the authors found several new conditions that were not mentioned in the studied literature, namely, citizens’ sense of urgency, competition among citizen-led OGD engagement initiatives, the diversity of citizens’ skills and capabilities and the intensive use of social media. The difference between the conditions and factors that played an important role in the case and those derived from the literature review might be because of the type of OGD engagement that the authors studied, namely, citizen-led engagement, without any government involvement. Research limitations/implications: The findings are derived using a single case study approach. Future research can investigate multiple cases and compare the conditions and factors for citizen-led engagement with OGD in different contexts. Practical implications: The conditions and factors for citizen-led engagement with OGD have been evaluated in practice and discussed with public managers and practitioners through interviews. Governmental organizations should prioritize and stimulate those conditions and factors that enhance OGD citizen engagement to create more value with OGD. Originality/value: While some research on government-led engagement with OGD exists, there is hardly any research on citizen-led engagement with OGD. This study is the first to develop a conceptual model of necessary conditions and factors for citizen engagement with OGD. Furthermore, the authors applied the developed multilevel conceptual model to a case study and gathered empirical evidence of OGD engagement and its contributions to solving societal problems, rather than staying at the conceptual level. This research can be used to investigate citizen engagement with OGD in other cases and offers possibilities for systematic cross-case lesson-drawing. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Citizens; Conditions; Engagement; Factors; Open data; Open government data; Use,,"Purwanto, A.; Technology Policy and Management Faculty, Netherlands; email: A.Purwanto@tudelft.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Our novel conceptual framework illustrates the implicit logic underlying OGD activities in the health domain and their anticipated impact on population health. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 50 diverse practitioners and policymakers from local, state, and federal agencies, and non-governmental organizations. Using a positive deviance approach, we identified innovative U.S. health agencies that were early OGD adopters. We analyzed transcripts using a grounded theory methodological approach to identify common themes. Results indicate that the OGD movement is marked by three major eras (pre-OGD early activities, Open Data 1.0, and Open Data 2.0), and U.S. health agencies are in different stages of evolution. Among innovative jurisdictions, OGD transitioned from an early focus on releasing large volumes of data to a more demand-driven approach to promote meaningful user engagement with data. Although engagement strategies could yield benefits, limited evidence exists on best practices for engaging diverse data users and many jurisdictions have not yet transitioned to this later phase.

Safarov I.,Institutional Dimensions of Open Government Data Implementation: Evidence from Transition Countries,2020,Public Performance and Management Review,,"Utrecht University, Netherlands","Over the past 10 years, we have observed a significant growth in open data adoption in governments across the globe. Potential barriers and enablers of open government data have been well-documented in the literature. However, nearly all of this research has been conducted in Western, democratic and developed societies, with very little known about open government data implementation in less developed countries. This article investigates how institutional dimensions affect open data implementation in six understudied countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. This research presents rich data based on an analysis of 31 documents and focus group discussions with a total of 89 participants. In general, we find that in these countries the same institutional dimensions influence OGD implementation as in their Western counterparts. A striking difference, however, is that we find open data implementation in transition countries to be much more fragile and highly dependent on foreign aid initiatives. This paper also strengthens the argument that institutional dimensions explain the performance of open data implementation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Thus, during the past few years, governments around the world have been under increasing pressure to release data to encourage citizen participation in government. In the UK, the government publishes its data on the data.gov.uk website for the public to find, view, download and interrogate. In this paper, we evaluate the extent of openness of OGD in the UK – a recognised global leader in the OGD movement – by examining a sample of 400 datasets listed on this website. The examination uses an ‘ordinary citizen’ test, which is developed based on the original eight Sebastopol principles of open data. Our examination discovers that existing prevalent measures of openness of data are inadequate. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the published government resources on the website are informational rather than granular data. In fact, only a small minority of these advertised as open data are actually open, which severely limits their open government utilities. © 2019",data.gov.uk; Granularity; Open data; Open government data; Ordinary citizen test,,"Wang, V.; Institute of Criminal Justice Studies, St George's Building, 141 High Street, United Kingdom; email: vichil471026@hotmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

We intend to help practitioners and researchers decide which benchmark instrument is most appropriate to evaluate a specific purpose. We aim to investigate the different dimensions that OGD benchmarks evaluate to discover what aspects of publishing and using open data they measure. To achieve this goal, we built upon previous research on how the Open Data Charter principles are measured in OGD assessments and enriched the analysis with additional dimensions. Findings reveal that what differentiates these benchmark instruments is their scope or focus, as their creators have varying interests and objectives. All benchmark instruments measure ""data openness""; however, each emphasizes different aspects of ""openness."" Concepts measured are deeply connected with the six Charter principles. OGD impact, use, and usefulness are addressed by half of the benchmark instruments. Measurements can be compared.

We conducted workshops in Belgium with nine researchers and eleven students and presented the model at a Scandinavian e-government workshop. The findings from the study show that information needs are complex and can be challenging to capture, but are one possible way to understand how the benefits of OGD could be realized. One practical implication is that publishers and data transformers should identify information needs in society, study existing solutions, and attempt to go beyond them with OGD.

Moles N.,Open government data (OGD): challenging the concept of a “Designated Community”,2020,Records Management Journal,,"Faculty of Information, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada","Purpose: This paper aims to explore the curation of government-produced datasets for release as open government data (OGD) from the perspective of the digital curation and preservation concept of a “Designated Community”. Specifically, it explores how digital curation functions when there is no clear Designated Community to which curation services can be targeted. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted through a case study of the City of Toronto’s efforts to revitalize their OGD program. Data was collected using three methods: semi-structured interviews, non-participative observation and document analysis. Findings: The curators of OGD responded to the absence of a Designated Community through two complementary methods. The first was to draw from the discourse that defines the OGD domain. The second was to take a participatory approach that incorporated members of the community surrounding OGD and various other stakeholders into the process of developing a plan for the revitalization of the program. Research limitations/implications: This study opens new directions for investigating the application of the Designated Community concept and its role in digital curation and preservation. Practical implications: The approach used by OGD curators in this case has the potential to be used in other curation situations where there is no clearly defined user group. Originality/value: The findings presented in this paper contribute empirical insights to on-going discussions on the concept of a Designated Community in digital curation and preservation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",City of Toronto; Designated Community; Digital curation; OAIS; Open data; Open government data,,"Moles, N.; Faculty of Information, Canada; email: n.moles@mail.utoronto.ca",English,Article,Article in Press,Scopus

The public sector has thus far mainly focused on the sharing of Open Government Data (OGD), often with a supply-driven approach with limited feedback-loops. We hypothesize that public sector organizations can extend the open innovation benefits by also creating platforms, where OGD, related OSS, and open standards are collaboratively developed and shared. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore how public sector organizations in the role of platform providers facilitate such collaboration in the form of OGD ecosystems and how the ecosystem’s governance may be structured to support the collaboration. Method: We conduct an exploratory multiple-case study of two such ecosystems, focused on OGD related to the Swedish labor market and public transport sector, respectively. Data is gathered through interviews, document studies, and prolonged engagement at one of the platform providers. Results: The study presents governance structure and collaboration practices of the two ecosystems and discusses how these contribute to the platform providers’ goals. The case studies highlight the need for platform providers to take an active and multi-functional role in enabling the sharing of data and software from and between the members of the ecosystem. Conclusions: We conclude that OGD ecosystems offer public sector organizations a possibility to catalyze the potential innovation output of OGD, but that it requires investment and adoption of an open and collaborative mindset. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Ecosystem; Open Government Data; Open Source Software; Open standard; Public sector,Cerium compounds; Data Sharing; e-government; Ecosystems; Open source software; Open systems; Collaboration practices; Governance structures; Knowledge-sharing; Multi-functional; Multiple-case study; Potential benefits; Public sector organization; Supply-driven approaches; Open Data,"Linåker, J.; Lund University, Ole Römers väg 3, Sweden; email: johan.linaker@cs.lth.se",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Accordingly, all governmental and non-governmental organizations may publish data that they own open for various purposes on the Internet without any restrictions such as (climate statistics, education statistics, transportation, industry, water abstraction, etc.). Further, Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives are proliferated in every country including Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). OGD should supposedly escalate the transparency, collaboration, and participation of citizens towards using OGD. However, the presentation of OGD format may not be attractive enough to users and vice-versa the data may not be easy for them to understand and interpret. These stumbling blocks may dampen the use of OGD among citizens. The problems can be resolved through visualization of the available data sets and to represent these data in accordance to user preference. This research emphasizes on visualization efforts of OGD in KSA named JeddahDashboard (JDB) website. The aim of creating JeddahDashBoard is to visualize the published government data in KSA. The idea was inspired by the DublinDashBoard in Ireland where data and real-time information, time series index data, and interactive maps on vast aspects of the city are provided mostly in an interactive ways and attractive charts that are easy to understand. In order to create JeddahDashBoard, two tools were used ""the tableau"" and then ""chart. js"" because the later was simple and flexible.

Private technology organizations are considered to be key players in the open government data ecosystem. Therefore, governments globally endeavor to encourage these organizations to adopt open government data to develop new social and economic benefits, products and services. However, adopting open government data is not an easy process because it relies on several factors. This research aims to investigate factors that may influence the decision of an organization to adopt open government data in Saudi Arabia. We have developed an integrated model to seek to understand why some organizations are willing to adopt open government data while others are not. This model was designed by combining aspects of two conceptual constructs, the technology-organization-environment framework and the information systems success model.

Rajabi E.,Towards linked open government data in Canada,2020,"International Journal of Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies",,"Shannon School of Business, Cape Breton University, Sydney, NS, Canada","Governments are publishing enormous amounts of open data on the web every day in an effort to increase transparency and reusability. Linking data from multiple sources on the web enables the performance of advanced data analytics, which can lead to the development of valuable services and data products. However, Canada's open government data portals are isolated from one another and remain unlinked to other resources on the web. In this paper, we first expose the statistical data sets in Canadian provincial open data portals as Linked Data, and then integrate them using RDF Cube vocabulary, thereby making different open data portals available through a single search endpoint.

Within the metadata of OGD data catalogs, the publishing organizations (1) are not uniquely and unambiguously identifiable and, even worse, (2) change over time, by public administration units being merged or restructured. In order to enable fine-grained analyzes or searches on Open Government Data on the level of publishing organizations, linking those from OGD portals to publicly available knowledge graphs (KGs) such as Wikidata and DBpedia seems like an obvious solution. Still, as we show in this position paper, organization linking faces significant challenges, both in terms of available (portal) metadata and KGs in terms of data quality and completeness. We herein specifically highlight five main challenges, namely regarding (1) temporal changes in organizations and in the portal metadata, (2) lack of a base ontology for describing organizational structures and changes in public knowledge graphs, (3) metadata and KG data quality, (4) multilinguality, and (5) disambiguating public sector organizations. Based on available OGD portal metadata from the Open Data Portal Watch, we provide an in-depth analysis of these issues, make suggestions for concrete starting points on how to tackle them along with a call to the community to jointly work on these open challenges. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Dataset evolution; Entity linking; Knowledge graph evolution; Knowledge graphs; Open data,Government data processing; Knowledge representation; Metadata; Open Data; Public administration; In-depth analysis; Knowledge graphs; Multilinguality; Organizational information; Organizational structures; Public knowledge; Public sector organization; Temporal change; Knowledge management,"Portisch, J.; Data and Web Science Group, Germany; email: jan@informatik.uni-mannheim.de",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

This paper presents a tentative workshop method to capture activity-based information needs of end-users in an everyday context, in order to inform publishers and inspire reusers to bridge the gap between them and end-users. The workshop is developed using design science research. It is presented as a facilitator script that can be used by practitioners, data providers, or reusers.

To increase economic growth, governments have therefore begun to liberate access to large parts of government data by developing open government data (OGD) initiatives. Since the emergence of OGD initiatives, many OGD portals have been launched. There is a common belief that sharing OGD throughout platforms would be sufficient to motivate companies to re-use data and improve economic growth. However, there is very little evidence about the quality of shared OGD. For companies to be able to re-use, share and create value from OGD, data publishers must meet certain good practice standards. Following a pragmatic research approach, in this paper we present an index that can be applied for the quality assessment of the published OGD on portals. On the basis of 17,777 published data resources gathered from the Swiss OGD portal (opendata.swiss), we demonstrate the logic of the index and discuss the key learnings we obtained from applying the index to this concrete case. We conclude that, in Switzerland, the adherence to good practice standards for publishing OGD is fairly low. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, such open government data (OGD) is facing major challenges with respect to data quality and limited use. To solve this problem, this study analyzes the factors driving the use of OGD from the perspective of data providers in the public sector. Design/methodology/approach: Using the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process methodologies, the importance of the factors driving the use of big data in the public sector was ranked. In addition, the different characteristics of tasks among the departments in a public agency were compared based on expert interviews. Findings: The factors driving OGD use are not only political environment or the technological environment. The importance of the institutional culture within the organization increases with the motivation of the data provider. The priorities of the OGD factors also depend on the objectives of the department involved. Originality/value: This study provides implications for improving the publication of open data by analyzing the priorities of the factors driving its use from the perspective of big data providers. It focuses on different perceptions of the factors valued by public officials in charge of data in institutions.

The roles-interest grid method is used to determine the stakeholder’s concerns and how they influence the decision-making process to open data. In addition to stakeholder theory, we employ muddling through and bounded rationality theories to create a comprehensive analysis of the decision-making process. Stakeholders are found to be diverse, where some are proponents of opening data, and others are risk-averse and do not favor disclosing data. Stakeholder’s responsible for the actual opening of data are often focused on the risks resulting in a tension between the ambitions of politicians to open data, and the practices of administrators and decision-makers.

Opening more datasets to external data analytics providers or other government organizations holds the potential to help governments to improve their processes by promoting a better understanding and enhancing the decision-making. Nevertheless, the decision-making to disclose datasets is challenging. Decision-makers often refuse to open their datasets due to several potential risks. In situations like the Dutch Customs, a dataset can contain competitive sensitive data, and multiple parties have to agree to open it.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to make better use of data. Combining the OGD and AI is crucial to generate more value from data. In this paper we investigate what kind of value was generated through AI and how. A context-input-process-output/outcome (CIPO) framework is developed to describe and compare three cases. The overview of cases shows the huge potential of AI, but it also suggests that AI is hardly used by the public to create value from open data. The objectives of the three cases are efficiency, innovation and crime prevention, whereas common open government objectives like transparency, accountability and participation are given less attention. By using AI, the risks of data privacy and arriving at biased or wrong conclusions become more prominent. With the rise of data collection from Internet of Things, complying with the 5-stars of Berners-Lee becomes more important. We recommend policy makers to stimulate AI projects contributing to the open government goals and ensure that open data meets the 5-star requirements. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Artificial Intelligence; Internet of Things; Open data; Open government; Smart cities; Value creation,Artificial intelligence; Cerium compounds; e-government; Privacy by design; Crime Prevention; Data collection; Exploratory studies; Policy makers; Process output; Open Data,"Gao, Y.; Huazhong University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: Y.Gao-2@tudelft.nl",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Learnings from corporate registers,2020,"DATA 2020 - Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Data Science, Technology and Applications",,"Department of Business and Economics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","Open data initiatives have long focused on motivating governmental bodies to open up their data. The number of open datasets is growing steadily, but their adoption is still lagging behind. An increasing number of studies assess open data portals and open data quality to shed light on open data’s current state. Since prior research addressed neither datasets’ content, nor whether it met enterprises’ data needs, our study aims to address this gap by investigating the extent to which open data is ready for use in the enterprise context. We focus on open corporate registers as an important segment of open government data with high relevance for enterprises. Our findings confirm that open datasets are heterogeneous in terms of access, licensing, and content, which makes them difficult to use in a business context. Our content analysis reveals that less than 50% of analyzed registers provide companies’ full legal addresses, while only 10% note their contact information. We conclude that open data in corporate registers has limited use to its lack of required attributes and relevant business concepts for typical use cases.

Open data refers to the openness of all the data related to government to its citizens so that the government becomes more and more transparent and to decrease negative activities. Transparency refers to the clear and clean image of a government towards its people, which increases the trust of people on their government. The motive of this study is to analyze the impact of e-government adoption and open government data on transparency in ASEAN countries. Two control variables i.e. literacy rate and corruption have also been used in the study. The past literature has also been discussed in literature review section of this study. In order to conduct research, data about the concerned variables of the study has been collected from ASEAN countries consisting of 29 years. After applying several tests and approaches for research purpose, the two major hypotheses of this study are accepted along with the impact of a control variable, corruption. However, the impact of other control variable i.e. literacy rate has been rejected. There are various theoretical, practical and policy making benefits that will increase the transparency. © 2020",ASEAN; E-Government; Open Data; Transparency,,"Jermsittiparsert, K.; MBA School, China; email: ajbamut@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus
"Carlitz R.D., McLellan R.","Open data from authoritarian regimes: New opportunities, new challenges",2021,Perspectives on Politics,,"Department of Political Science, Tulane University, United States; Princeton University, United States","Data availability has long been a challenge for scholars of authoritarian politics. However, the promotion of open government data - through voluntary initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership and soft conditionalities tied to foreign aid - has motivated many of the world's more closed regimes to produce and publish fine-grained data on public goods provision, taxation, and more. While this has been a boon to scholars of autocracies, we argue that the politics of data production and dissemination in these countries create new challenges. Systematically missing or biased data may jeopardize research integrity and lead to false inferences. We provide evidence of such risks from Tanzania. The example also shows how data manipulation fits into the broader set of strategies that authoritarian leaders use to legitimate and prolong their rule. Comparing data released to the public on local tax revenues with verified internal figures, we find that the public data appear to significantly underestimate opposition performance. This can bias studies on local government capacity and risk parroting the party line in data form. We conclude by providing a framework that researchers can use to anticipate and detect manipulation in newly available data. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Data service is a critical component for OGD which guarantees the availability of government data to users in the form of structured and machine-readable open datasets. Aspects such as usability, quality, and interoperability should be considered in building such open datasets. The diversity of data sets usually hampers unlocking the full potential value of data. Interoperability addresses the ability of open data platforms and data services to communicate, exchange and consume data, and to operate effectively together. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based technique enabling governmental organizations to identify their public data and publish them via well-defined interoperable data services. In this context, an Open Governmental Data Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) is designed and developed to fulfill this goal. As a case study, the constructed platform has been utilized and evaluated in the Tehran Municipality organization. The results show that applying the proposed approach leads to the creation of high-quality datasets achieving a high degree of interoperability. © 2020 IEEE.",Data interoperability; Electronic data service; Electronic government; Government data publishing; Ontology; Open data,Information management; Interoperability; Ontology; Social computing; Critical component; Data interoperability; Data management system; Government administration; Ontology-based; Paradigm shifts; Potential values; Social innovations; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Publishing CSV data as a Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web is an active field of research. However, there are very few effective applications have been developed with this purpose. Linked Data refer many ways for connecting and publishing structured data to data consumers, but available datasets are in CSV format. Therefore, publishing the CSV model on the webpage, it is needed to change CSV in RDF file format. Many methods and tools have been proposed for data mapping and publishing, however, most of them are not followed by the W3C recommendations rules. The contribution and goal of this paper are to develop a Semantic approach that can effectively convert CSV data into RDF data with rich semantics and release RDF data on the web using LOD principles. We utilize Semantic Web resources and W3C recommendation rules in automatic data publishing method, which enables distributed system for scalability. We apply the proposed method to existing CSVW Implementation Report-W3C and U.S Government’s application (data.gov ).

The presence of flood and drought years influences the cultivation system and thus, the economy of the country as the Indian agricultural system is highly dependent on the natural rainfall. This study aims to identify the flood and drought years for the north-east Indian region from 1916 to 2015 by using sub-divisional rainfall data collected from Open Government Data (OGD) Platform of India. For this investigation, the normalized index (NI) of annual rainfall is utilized to recognize a particular year as drought or flood year. The century-long monthly rainfall data collected for four sub-divisions of the north-east Indian region spanning across 9 states (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim, and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal) is utilized to compute the annual rainfall, average, standard deviation, and the normalized index. The results for each sub-division have been plotted to identify the normal, drought, or flood years. The results reveal that there is a significant inter-Annual variation of rainfall over all the sub-divisions, leading to frequent drought and flood years. This study recommends the application of the normalized index over north-east Indian region due to its ease of computation and uniformity. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Drought and Flood Years; Monsoon; Normalized Index; North-East Indian region; Rainfall,Agricultural robots; Climate change; Cultivation; Drought; Floods; Groundwater; Rain; Sustainable development; Agricultural system; Annual rainfall; Climatic conditions; Interannual variation; Monthly rainfalls; Natural rainfalls; Southwest monsoon; Standard deviation; Groundwater resources,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

In the last decade, the advancement of the Web 2.0 technology is improving the accessibility of web of data across the cloud. Linked Open Data, Linked Open Statistical Data, and Open Government Data is increasing massively, creating a more significant computer-recognizable data available for sharing. In agricultural production analytics, data resources with high availability and accessibility is a primary requirement. However, today’s data accessibility for production analytics is limited in the 2 or 3-stars open data format and rarely has attributes for spatiotemporal analytics. The new data warehouse concept has a new approach to combine the openness of data resources with mobility or spatiotemporal data in nature. This new approach could help the decision-makers to use external data to make a crucial decision more intuitive and flexible. This paper proposed the development of a spatiotemporal data warehouse with an integration process using service-oriented architecture and open data sources. The data sources are originating from the Village and Rural Area Information System (SIDeKa) that capture the agricultural production transaction in a daily manner. This paper also describes the way to spatiotemporal analytics for agricultural production using a new spatiotemporal data warehouse approach. The experiment results, by executing six relevant spatiotemporal query samples on DW with fact table contains 324096 tuples with temporal integer/float for each tuple, 4495 tuples of field dimension with geographic data as polygons, 80 tuples of village dimension, dozens of tuples of the district, subdistrict, province dimensions. The DW time dimension contains 3653 tuples representing a date for ten years, proved that this new approach has a convenient, simple model, and expressive performance for supporting executive to make decisions on agriculture production analytics based on spatiotemporal data.

Chen P.-Y.,Academic social networks and collaboration patterns,2019,Library Hi Tech,1,"Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Purpose: This study attempts to use a new source of data collection from open government data sets to identify potential academic social networks (ASNs) and defines their collaboration patterns. The purpose of this paper is to propose a direction that may advance our current understanding on how or why ASNs are formed or motivated and influence their research collaboration. Design/methodology/approach: This study first reviews the open data sets in Taiwan, which is ranked as the first state in Global Open Data Index published by Open Knowledge Foundation to select the data sets that expose the government’s R&D activities. Then, based on the theory review of research collaboration, potential ASNs in those data sets are identified and are further generalized as various collaboration patterns. A research collaboration framework is used to present these patterns. Findings: Project-based social networks, learning-based social networks and institution-based social networks are identified and linked to various collaboration patterns. Their collaboration mechanisms, e.g., team composition, motivation, relationship, measurement, and benefit-cost, are also discussed and compared. Originality/value: In traditional, ASNs have usually been known as co-authorship networks or co-inventorship networks due to the limitation of data collection. This study first identifies some ASNs that may be formed before co-authorship networks or co-inventorship networks are formally built-up, and may influence the outcomes of research collaborations. These information allow researchers to deeply dive into the structure of ASNs and resolve collaboration mechanisms. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries; Collaborative alliances; Data collection; Information networks; Information society; Research,,"Chen, P.-Y.; Industry, Taiwan; email: pychen@itri.org.tw",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Present study is an exploratory study that seeks to analyze international models of open government data ecosystem, and identify and monitor the elements and components of the open government data ecosystem. Open government data ecosystem models were redefined and its contents were extracted by content analysis method and then compared and evaluated. Units in this study are open government data ecosystem models and sampling is targeted sampling. In the first stage, 36 models were identified by searching and reviewing the models of open government data ecosystems. Finally, by studying these models and identifying the similarities and aggregating of some models, based on targeted sampling, the researchers considered 12 models of open government data ecosystem and by examining them they extracted the data and information from these models. The reason for choosing these 12 models is their reputation, influence, comprehensiveness and authority. By examining existing models, it has become clear that there is still no comprehensive model of an open government data ecosystem that could be the basis for developing an open government data policy.

Surprisingly, our study suggests that whether an open government data initiative delivers a benefit (e.g. increased openness, trust or innovation) is not significantly affected by having an objective related to the delivery of that benefit. The objectives of state- and national-level open government data initiatives are more often achieved than those of local- and regional-level open government data initiatives. © The Author(s) 2018.",attainment; benefits; delivery; evaluation; implementation; objectives; open data; open government; open government data; open science,administrative framework; economic analysis; governance approach; innovation; literature review; methodology,"Zuiderwijk, A.; Delft University of TechnologyNetherlands; email: a.m.g.zuiderwijk-vaneijk@tudelft.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

This paper studies the evolution of OGDP in the 28 countries of the European Union (EU) in a multidisciplinary setting. Whereas the comparative frameworks in the literature are mostly based only on technological parameters, this exploratory research aims to uncover which factors might uphold the successful development of OGDP through the analysis of the relationships between a number of technical and socioeconomical indicators over a period of three years (2015–2017), using a clustering methodology. The results show that EU countries are slowly homogenizing their OGD approaches into two currents/speeds, based mainly on economic factors and open government development status.

Open Government Data (OGD) has been initiated by many governments worldwide aiming to publicly and freely share government data via online. In a similar effort, the government of Malaysia has launched an OGD portal in 2014 and currently more than 12,000 data sets are available for citizens and businesses to access. However, there is a concern on the level of usage of these datasets. Additionally, there is lack of empirical studies done to understand this issue. The purpose of this study is to fill this gap. Based on a questionnaire survey method, data was collected from Malaysian researchers and academicians to understand their use of OGD. Despite a rather small sample of 62 responses, the findings shed light on the access and purposes of using OGD in the Malaysia context. © 2019 IEEE.",OGD Malaysia; OGD portal; OGD Use; Open government data,Data Sharing; Government data processing; Information systems; Information use; Surveys; Empirical studies; Malaysia; Malaysians; Questionnaire surveys; Small samples; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The call for OGD has been especially pronounced in the last 6 or 7 years. OGD demand accelerated after the launch of the US OGD initiative portal in 2009, followed by the UK in 2010. Before that, the availability and accessibility of government data were limited to certain executives and few government employees, whereas for others, it was either partially available or completely unavailable. Publishing government data, thereby making it available to the public, could be useful in many ways such as increasing transparency and accountability in governments, increasing overall efficiency and performance, encouraging publics’ engagement, and achieving trust and reputation. As an example of the role that OGD may provide, this paper compares the different financial reporting and auditing systems in the public sector between Brazil and Saudi Arabia. Also, the paper examines OGD initiatives among different countries with the focus of the Republic of Brazil and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s open data portals. Moreover, it assesses the level of data transparency based on the definition of the open data model, and more importantly, the paper suggests new dimensions to the open data concept when utilized by governments. In addition, it argues that the OGD in Saudi Arabia, which is an emerging initiative in a country that has centralized power, could be improved dramatically. We demonstrate by using a sample of procurement contracts data taken from the Council of Saudi Chambers Web site, which is publicly available and shows the potential of monitoring or auditing public spending. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",Auditing; Data transparency; Effective and efficient governments; Financial reporting; Open government data; Saudi Arabia,,"Vasarhelyi, M.A.; Rutgers, One Washington Park, United States; email: miklosv@business.rutgers.edu",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Governments around the world often understand that open data is disclosing their data to the public as much as possible and that open data success is the result of a data and technology-related endeavor rather than the result of organizational, institutional, and environmental attributes. According to the resource-based theory, however, managerial capability to mobilize tangible and intangible resources and deploy them in adequate places or processes under the leadership of capable leaders during the information technology (IT) project is a core factor leading to organizational performance such as open data success. In this vein, this study aims to analyze managerial factors as drivers and challenges of open data success from the resource-based theory. Findings illustrate that managerial factors are the driving forces that often boost or hinder open data success when institutional, socio-economic, and demographic factors are controlled. Discussion illustrates theoretical and practical implications for the managerial factors as drivers and challenges of open data success in terms of the comparison between technological determinism and the socio-technical perspective. © 2019 by the authors.

Business Intelligence using Data Warehouse, Multidimensional data, and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) has proven to be useful for obtaining information and knowledge relevant to the business. Nowadays the development of the internet with Web 2.0 model is increasing the availability of data over the internet. Linked Open Data (LOD), Open Data, and Open Government Data is constantly growing, producing a large amount of valuable data in the form of semi-structured data, flexible and machine-readable. Data sharing on agricultural production is one of the requirements for the best of analysis of agricultural production, but most of the data is still in the format of 2/3-stars open data and does not yet have spatial data that facilitates analysis based on spatial dimensions. The emerging open data concept makes the data warehouse more dynamic and can accommodate external data. Spatiotemporal support in open data also enables a more sophisticated analysis of data with spatial queries. This research develops tools to integrate agricultural data originating from the Village and Rural Area Information Systems (SIDeKa) that has open distributed data, a service-oriented approach, and spatiotemporal data.

Data preparation is labour intensive because the data scientist typically takes fine grained control over each aspect of each step in the process, motivating the development of techniques that seek to reduce this burden. Results: This paper presents an architecture in which the data scientist need only describe the intended outcome of the data preparation process, leaving the software to determine how best to bring about the outcome. Key wrangling decisions on matching, mapping generation, mapping selection, format transformation and data repair are taken by the system, and the user need only provide: (i) the schema of the data target; (ii) partial representative instance data aligned with the target; (iii) criteria to be prioritised when populating the target; and (iv) feedback on candidate results. To support this, the proposed architecture dynamically orchestrates a collection of loosely coupled wrangling components, in which the orchestration is declaratively specified and includes self-tuning of component parameters. Conclusion: This paper describes a data preparation architecture that has been designed to reduce the cost of data preparation through the provision of a central role for automation. An empirical evaluation with deep web and open government data investigates the quality and suitability of the wrangling result, the cost-effectiveness of the approach, the impact of self-tuning, and scalability with respect to the numbers of sources. © 2019, The Author(s).",Data integration; Data preparation; Data quality,,"Paton, N.W.; School of Computer Science, Oxford Road, United Kingdom; email: norman.paton@manchester.ac.uk",English,Article,Final,Scopus

However, the number of available OGD datasets has increased significantly with pressure being put on government agencies to publish their data. This makes the task of discovering relevant datasets difficult and time-consuming and hinder consequently the reuse of OGD. Therefore, reinforcing OGD portals with tools to improve data discoverability by proposing relevant content to the user's needs can improve the reuse of OGD.

We investigate the SA experience with the first generation of broadband services (FGB) in Italy, whose market was long plagued by extensive market failures, largely due to market power. By exploiting original open Government data and sources, we analyse the main domains of the EU SA policy, and assess whether its ex ante goals have been met in Italy. Four main results stand out. First, the plan extended the FGB coverage of rural areas, although with a substantial delay and incompletely, with respect to the ambitious targets of the Digital Agenda for Europe. Second, public consultations have significantly increased the transparency of the market and of the SA intervention, promoting investment and a gradual increase in the efficiency of public procurement. Third, the direct effects of SA on competitive entry appear less pronounced, at least in the static sense. Fourth, the final matching between allocative and dynamic efficiency of SA policy, and its coherence with industrial and innovation policies remain critical, based on the Italian experience: in fact, the persisting digital divide affecting the business-rich areas depicts another relevant instance of partial Government failure. © 2019",Broadband; Italy; Open government data; Policy impact evaluation; State aid control,Commerce; Efficiency; Government data processing; Investments; Open Data; Broadband; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Government failures; Impact evaluation; Innovation policies; Italy; Open government data; Public consultation; Public policy,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

As a result, we can witness an increasing amount of government open data shared on public government's portals that become sources of rich big data. While this scenario provides data transparency and eases accessibility for public data consumers, the quality aspect, or the veracity property (as commonly coined to big data) of open data is the topic of concerned. Not only poor quality data causes misleading results, the reputation of the government as an open data provider can also be negatively affected. Thus, to understand how the government's portals deal with the veracity aspect of their data, in this paper, we present the results of examining quality criteria imposed by selected government's data portals for their data contributors. In particular, we extract quality criteria from the open data policy of the government's data portals under study. The result shows that out of 108 portals, only 27% of the portals explicitly state their quality criteria in the policy, with varying coverage of quality criteria. The frequency of the identified 15 quality criteria shows the types of quality criteria that receive more (and less) attention by the open data portals based on their relative importance.

Despite their essential role and the great potential benefits open government holds for the public, challenges of use among citizens persist. Previous empirical research has scarcely addressed these issues from a citizen perspective. This study investigates the determinants of open government data use by citizens in Germany. Our results indicate that ease of use, usefulness, as well as transparency, participation and collaboration expectancies significantly determine citizens’ intention to use open government data, which in turn positively affects their word-of-mouth intention. Overall, the findings not only contribute to our understanding of citizen behavior in the context of open government research, especially shedding light on the key aspects of citizens’ usage intention, but also provide implications for both researchers and practitioners. Points for practitioners: Citizen-based use of open government data (OGD) has multiple facets that practitioners should be aware of. Public administration needs to take account of the important role of accessibility and usability in providing OGD services, with the objective of meeting the major challenge of enabling equal access for all populations via appropriate channels and customization. The content-related preparation of OGD services should seek to enhance transparency, participation and collaboration, raising and shaping respective expectations among citizens. Finally, practitioners should pay particular attention to the opportunities and risks associated with word-of-mouth communication in the context of OGD. © The Author(s) 2017.",citizen use; e-democracy; empirical analysis; open government; structural equation model; word of mouth,accessibility; advocacy; governance approach; information and communication technology; local participation; participatory approach; partnership approach; research work; Germany,"Wirtz, B.W.; German University of Administrative Sciences SpeyerGermany; email: Ls-wirtz@uni-speyer.de",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Therefore, this study drew on Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and its application to public policy innovation research to examine patterns of BOD policy innovation diffusion at government and public bodies’ level in Pakistan. These patterns are based on policy declaration timing by the governments, policy adoption timing, development of technological applications, and proactively released datasets statistics in public bodies. An Event History Analysis was carried out to examine BOD policy innovation diffusion patterns. Results showed that Federal government is the innovator for the policy innovation diffusion across different governments and subsequent public bodies. It was also found that efficacy ranking of public bodies is quite low in terms of developing BOD technological platforms and proactive release of datasets in large quantities.

Although, different practices for data publishing have led to misalignment, underuse and repetition of information (Bizer et al., 2011). For this reason, the Public Administrations have undergone efforts on integrating the information and promoting interoperability through the implementation of best practices, as for example, the use of a common semantics vocabulary for the metadata (DCAT) as proposed by the ISA2 programme of the European Commission. The Interreg Italy-Switzerland GIOCOnDA project has been proposed for enhancing the data sharing processes in the cross-border area, particularly addressing tourism and mobility that are key economic activities for the region. For this work, a review on the data catalogues published in dati.lombardia.it and opendata.swiss is presented. The revision of the datasets showed the need for: 1) defining common semantics for the description of the categories of data to avoid the arbitrary use of vocabularies, and 2) adopting standards for the description of geodata. On the other hand, it was observed the potential to gather existing information to produce geodata querying the datasets with specific keywords that can provide spatial information. Open data, as well as the use of best practices for publishing data, push towards the use of FOSS.

Municipal open data policies are often supply-driven and not based on residents' wishes. Municipalities lack insight into residents' perspectives on opening up municipal data and often do not know how to take them into account when developing their open data policies. This paper aims to reveal residents' perspectives on municipal open data policies and provide recommendations for municipalities on how to account for them when developing future open data policies. Using Q-methodology and applying it to the municipality of Delft in the Netherlands, we elicited the perspective of four main groups of residents on the development of the municipal open data policy as follows: 1) 'the oblivious residents', 2) 'the distrustful residents', 3) 'the trusting, passive residents', and 4) 'the open data advocates'. We found that all residents considered transparency important for the quality of public administration, and that municipal transparency is currently lacking. We then provide recommendations for policy makers responsible for municipal open data policies and suggest directions for open data theory development concerning municipal open data policy. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

In response to these calls, we develop a theoretical framework based on an ethnographic study of civic use of OGD in Hong Kong. We argue that constrained by the deliberative democracy models that focus on existing mechanisms of political participation, researchers have tended to overlook the use of OGD for protests, contestation, and other expressions of adversarial politics, which also produce a use of OGD for social impacts. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

OGD is interoperable data that is shared by public organisations (publishers) for anyone (users) to reuse without restrictions to create new digital products and services. The user process was roughly identified in previous research but lacks an in-depth description. This lack can hamper the ability to encourage the use and the development of related theories. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage research approach was used. First, a tentative framework was created from previous research and empirical material. This stage involved three different literature reviews, data mapping and seven interviews with OGD experts. The empirical material was analysed with inductive analysis, and previous research was integrated into the framework through concept mapping. Second, the tentative framework was reviewed by informed OGD experts. Third, the framework was finalised with additional literature reviews, eight interviews with OGD users, and a member check, including all the respondents. The framework was used to guide the data collection and as a tool in the analysis. Findings: The user process framework covers activities and related variations, where the included phases are: start, identify, acquire, enrich and deploy. The start varies relating to the intended use of the OGD. In the identify phase, the user is exploring the accessible data to decide if the data are relevant. In the acquire phase, the user is preparing for the delivery of the data from the publisher and receiving it. In the enrich phase, the user is concocting and making something. In the final deploy phase, the user has a product or service that can be provided to end-users. Research limitations/implications: The framework development has some limitations: the framework needs testing and development in different contexts and further verification. The implications are that the framework can help guide researchers towards relevant and essential data of the user process, be used as a point of comparison in analysis, and be used as a skeleton for more precious theories. Practical implications: The framework has some practical implications for users, publishers and portals. It can introduce users to the user process and help them plan for the execution of it. The framework can help publishers understand how the users can work with their data and what can be expected of them. The framework can help portal owners to understand the portal’s role between users and publishers and what functionality and features they can provide to support to the user. Originality/value: In previous research, no user process with an in-depth description was identified. However, several studies have given a rough recall. Thus, this research provides an in-depth description of the user process with its variations. The framework can support practice and leads to new research avenues. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Activity; Concept mapping; Descriptive theory; Framework; Open government data; Phase; Process; Reuse; Use; User,,"Crusoe, J.R.; Division of Information Systems, Sweden; email: Jonathan.Crusoe@liu.se",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Combining and analyzing Open Data from multiple datasets and sources enable the performance of advanced data analytics scenarios that could result in valuable services and data products. However, it is still difficult to discover and combine Open Statistical Data that reside in different data portals. Although Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD) provide standards and approaches to facilitate combining statistics on the Web, various interoperability challenges still exist. In this paper, we propose an Interoperability Framework for LOSD, comprising definitions of LOSD interoperability conflicts as well as modelling practices currently used by six official open government data portals. Towards this end, we combine a top-down approach that studies interoperability conflicts in the literature with a bottom-up approach that studies the modelling practices of data portals. We define two types of LOSD schema-level conflicts, namely naming conflicts and structural conflicts. Naming conflicts result from using different URIs. Structural conflicts result from different practices of modelling the structure of data cubes.

Recently, governments have started to use this technology for bridging separated data “(silos)” by launching linked open government data (LOGD) portals. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of LOGD as a smart technology and strategy to create public value. This is achieved by enhancing the usability and visibility of open data provided by public organizations. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, three different LOGD governance modes are deduced: public agencies could release linked data via a dedicated triple store, via a shared triple store or via an open knowledge base. Each of these modes has different effects on usability and visibility of open data. Selected case studies illustrate the actual use of these three governance modes. Findings: According to this study, LOGD governance modes present a trade-off between retaining control over governmental data and potentially gaining public value by the increased use of open data by citizens. Originality/value: This study provides recommendations for public sector organizations for the development of their data publishing strategy to balance control, usability and visibility considering also the growing popularity of open knowledge bases such as Wikidata. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data governance; Linked data; Linked open government data; Open data; Public value; Wikidata,,"Hitz-Gamper, B.S.; Institute of Information Systems, Switzerland; email: benedikt.hitz@iwi.unibe.ch",English,Article,Final,Scopus

In the UK, this has resulted in the introduction of key legislation, such as the Freedom of Information Act 2010, and the Data Protection Act 2018. However, there is insufficient empirical knowledge and evidence to support the extent as to which the intended possibilities of OGD (transparency, releasing social and commercial value, and participation and engagement) have been realized. This article investigates these supposed possibilities and suggests that they may be impossibilities instead. IMPACT: Open government data has long been widely heralded as a mechanism to underpin policy-making, improve citizen engagement, and stimulate innovation. Despite the wealth of literature disputing these aspects individually, this article challenges the perceived benefits collectively against a backdrop of changing political climate and policy.

In this regard, paying special attention to the investigation of main drivers, stakeholders and challenges of the open data movement in Estonia, the author argues that a highly centralized administrative policy that has been widely used previously by authorities in advancing various technology-driven public reforms, which partly explains a truly impressive advance of this Nordic state in e-government, e-commerce, e-banking and evoting, does not necessarily lead to same effective results in the open data domain. On the contrary, the presence of established democratic institutions and developed civil society as well as an incredibly advanced and dynamic private ICTindustry that values competition and professional curiosity along with a very strong sense of patriotism and adherence to a particular neighborhood deeply rooted in Estonian society has played a much more important role in diffusing the concept rather than just traditional government directives and strategies. © 2017, © 2017 Commonwealth Secretariat.",civic engagement; e-democracy; e-government; Estonia; freedom of information; Open data; open government,e-government; Electronic commerce; Information services; Civic engagement; E-democracy; Estonia; Freedom of informations; open government; Open Data,"Kassen, M.; Eurasian Humanities Institute, Zhumabayev ave 4, Kazakhstan; email: maka.mca2@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

These data can be accessed freely by anyone, in order to increase public participation and enable government agencies to report their performance transparently. Indonesia is one of many countries that has been applying open government data concept, by establishing Open Government Indonesia (OGI). With the establishment of the OGI, many Indonesian government agencies have developed open government data. However, many of them have low data quality. One standard that can assess open government data quality is Five Star Open Data. This standard uses 5-step concept, with each data requires particular quality to achieve those steps. This paper proposed a solution to enhance the data quality of Indonesian government data and develop a data publishing tool. This data publishing tool accepts data with 2-star and 3-star quality and enhances the quality of input data to 5-star quality respectively. This tool also publishes the data and generates several types of data visualization according to the data. This tool uses data from Hasan Sadikin General Public Hospital (RSHS) as test data. Based on the evaluation conducted, this tool can enhance the data quality of five datasets, from 2-star to 5-star quality. In addition, the tool publishes the datasets and generates data visualization based on the datasets' contents. © 2019 IEEE.",data visualization; Five Star Open Data; government data; hospital data; open government data,Data reduction; Data visualization; Government data processing; Hospitals; Visualization; Data publishing; Data quality; General publics; Government agencies; Indonesia; Input datas; Public participation; Test data; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducted a bibliometric mapping study on OGD scientific research publications based on WOS from six aspects. Findings: There are six research perspectives on OGD research. European countries and developed countries pay more attention to OGD movement. The 20 most cited and highly influential research documents were identified. What’s more, the analysis of journals level highlights the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary characteristics of OGD research. Current six research topics for OGD research that have been formed and two major emerging research priorities in OGD research fields were identified. Research limitations/implications: The limitation is that data retrieval result which decided to include only 180 publications in the WOS-indexed publications produced a bias against research publications published in non-WOS publication sources. A fuller research trend would be obtained with the more extensively used electronic databases. Practical implications: By dint of bibliometric analysis, this paper may be able to quantify research patterns on OGD, to analyze what has been done in this field and to identify the main research hotspots. Therefore, it can aid academic researchers and practicing professionals in contributing to the field more effectively and advancing scientific progress in the field of OGD research.

Specifically, we look at the Census Hub of the European Statistical System and the Danish Ministry of Education’s Data Warehouse. These portals form part of open government data initiatives, which we understand as governing technologies. We argue that to function as such, aesthetic practices are required so that data produced at dispersed sites can be brought into relation and projected as populations in forms such as bar charts, heat maps and tables. Two examples of aesthetic practices are analysed based on ethnographic studies we have conducted on the production of data for the Hub and Warehouse: metadata and data cleaning. Metadata enables data to come into relation by containing and accounting for (some of) the differences between data. Data cleaning deals with the indeterminacies and absences of data and involves algorithms to determine what values data can obtain so they can be brought into relation. We attend to how both aesthetic practices involve normative decisions that make absent what exceeds them: embodied knowledge that cannot or has not been documented as well as data that cannot meet the forms required of data portals. While these aesthetic practices are necessary to sustain data portals as ‘sites of projection,’ we also bring critical attention to their performative effects for knowing, enacting and governing populations. © The Author(s) 2019.",Aesthetic practice; data cleaning; data portals; embodied knowledge; metadata; open government data,,"Ratner, H.; Danish School of Education, Denmark; email: helr@edu.au.dk",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Pedro I (SP-65), Km 143,6 Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo (SP)  CEP 13069-901, Brazil; Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil","The rising number of data portals has been increasing demand for new techniques to assess data openness in an automated manner. Some methods have emerged that presuppose well-organized data catalogs, the availability of API interfaces and natively exposed metadata. However, many data portals, particularly those of local governments, appear to be misimplemented and developed with the classic website model in mind, which provides access to data only through user interaction with web forms. Data in such portals resides in the hidden part of the web, as it is dynamically produced only in response to direct requests. This paper proposes an automated method for assessing government-related data in the deep web on the basis of compliance with open data principles and requirements. To validate our method, we apply it in an experiment using the government websites of the 27 Brazilian capitals. The method is fully carried out for 22 of the capitals' websites, resulting in the analysis of 5.6 million government web pages. The results indicate that the keyword search approach utilized in the method, along with the checking of web pages for multifield web forms, is effective for identifying deep web data sources, as 1.5% of web pages with potential government data that are analyzed are found to contain data stored in the deep web. This work contributes to the development of a novel method that allows for the continuous checking and identification of government data from surface web data portals.

The Ecological Model of Active Living was proposed to examine whether individuals participate in active living. The purpose of this study was to understand the determinants of physical activity and create a predictive path model of the intrapersonal, perceived environment, behavior settings, and policy environment domains. Data were obtained from open government data and questionnaires, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Health Belief Model Inventory, Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Survey, and Accessibility of Open Spaces. Participants comprised 1085 healthy adults who completed a self-reported internet survey. An analysis of the intrapersonal domain revealed that the variables of female, an older age, and a low educational level, and individuals with obesity or cardiometabolic diseases presented lower odds ratios for active living. We found significant statistical support for our path model (The Ecological Model of Active Living), with a predictive power of 23.1%. The predictive path model is a good approach to quantitatively measure the impacts of various determinants on active living that suggests further lines of research in approaches for modeling relationships. © 2019 Yen, Li.

This data can be leveraged for back testing, decision making, forecast modelling, and risk assessment and so on. The Government dataset available in the portals (Data.gov.in) is only raw format, as the data is provided in raw format (.csv,.json etc.), it is hard to make much sense of it without pre-processing and filter. It requires some level of technical expertise to compile, filter, transform and visualize the data to make sense. In the proposed system implemented the mobile application to importing datasets from public domain sources and then plotting for user-understanding and friendly manner. As most of the goods prices move because of the supply-demand differences, the proposed Japanese candlestick charts used to predict/forecast patterns in short term and long term by capturing the change in trend using moving averages, pattern recognition methods. This forecasting model has been used in japan to forecast wheat/grain prices with high level of accuracy. As most of the Small and Medium Business owners, farmers, Traders are not so tech-savvy it become a hurdle for them to get data and interpret metrics from it.

This agreement is also applied in Indonesia. One of the most important problems in managing Open Government Data (OGD) is the ability to collect, classify information, publish, and present information. OGD management in Indonesia is carried out by the Information and Document Management Officer (IDMO). Research on OGD in Indonesia is still very minimal and limited to the issue of initiating the implementation of OGD. In fact, the problems that occur are not only at the organizational level, but also need to be focused on the actors or information management employees working on IDMOs. The important thing is how OGD should be managed, so that all information which are produced must be carried out for the benefit of the community. When the right OGD management model can be carried out, then the concept of service to the community should also be developed and implemented as better as possible as a manifestation of the sustainability of OGD implementation. This study uses a qualitative method with the chosen rationality approach is the soft systems methodology (SSM). The results obtained from this study are the OGD management model that adopts the SHEL concept, namely strengthening the understanding, use and strengthening of software, hardware, environment and life-ware. And when the SHEL can be done well, the concept of service to the community must also be improved by adopting the concept of RATER (Reliability, Assurance, Tangible, Empathy, and Responsiveness). The combination of SHEL and RATER is a conceptual model and change plan to strengthen management and maintain the sustainability of OGD implementation in Indonesia through IDMO in all local governments. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",OGD management; OGD sustainability; RATER; Shel model; Soft-system methodology,,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

The study is exploratory and employs a combined quantitative analysis of secondary data, which were analyzed through PLS. The reduction of bureaucracy has shown a more significant effect that the opening of data related to corruption perception in the 164 countries analyzed. Results show that government open data disclosure and the level of reduction in bureaucracy contribute to making a country less vulnerable to corruption; nonetheless, debureaucratization presented a superior and more significant effect. The results show that debureaucratization might be a starting point for initiatives against corruption, especially in countries with limited financial resources, and that it can support governmental decision-making in this regard. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Data wrangling, even with tool support, is typically a labour intensive process. One aspect of data wrangling involves carrying out format transformations on attribute values, for example so that names or phone numbers are represented consistently. Recent research has developed techniques for synthesizing format transformation programs from examples of the source and target representations. This is valuable, but still requires a user to provide suitable examples, something that may be challenging in applications in which there are huge datasets or numerous data sources. In this paper, we investigate the automatic discovery of examples that can be used to synthesize format transformation programs. In particular, we propose two approaches to identifying candidate data examples and validating the transformations that are synthesized from them.

As an example, the paper investigates the national OGD portal of India (www.data.gov.in) and provides implications of the proposed TQM model for the Indian case. Design/methodology/approach: The TQM model for the OGD initiatives (16 dimensions in terms of drivers, enablers and results) is derived from the extant literature on the principles of TQM and OGD. The proposed model is used for drawing implications for the Indian OGD initiative. Findings: The application of TQM model for the OGD initiative in India would help in quality maintenance and sustainability. The quality of the OGD portal should be improved by taking the TQM model as a point of reference. Practical implications: Ensuring quality of the datasets is important for any OGD initiative. The proposed TQM model leaves insights for the practitioners (policymakers and administrators) to implement the TQM model in the OGD policy initiatives. This would lead to increased trust, transparency and accountability. Social implications: Through the integration of the TQM model in the OGD initiative of the country, a wider section of the stakeholders may tap the qualitatively advanced datasets for value creation. Citizen participation and engagement would increase with the integration of the TQM model in the OGD initiative. Originality/value: While management of quality in the OGD initiatives has been underlined in the extant OGD-focused literature, the utility of applying TQM principles in OGD initiatives has not been conceived so far.

Remarkably, 43% of the entire population of prominent websites are hosted in the United States (Fig. 1). Even though most data content on the Web is unstructured, the US government has had big contributions in producing and actively releasing structured datasets related to different fields such as health, education, safety and finance. Aforementioned datasets are referred to as Open Government Data (OGD) and are aimed at increasing the structured data pool in conjunction with promoting government transparency and accountability. In this paper, we present a new system “OGDXplor” which processes raw OGD through a well-defined procedure leveraging machine learning algorithms and produces meaningful insights. The novelty of this work is encompassed by the collective approach utilized in developing the system and tackling challenges. First by addressing arising challenges due to data being collected and aggregated from heterogeneous sources that otherwise would have been impossible to acquire as a comprehensive unit. moreover, classification and comparisons are drawn on a much finer level that we refer to as zone level. Zones are the areas encompassed and defined by zip codes and are seldomly used in classifying and extracting insights as presented here. OGDXplor facilitates comparing and classifying zones located in different cities or zones within an individual city. The system is presented to end-users as a web application allowing users to elect zones and features relevant to their use case.

The proposed architecture, called OntoGenesis, is able to semantically enrich data services, so that they can dynamically provide both semantic descriptions and data representations. Design/methodology/approach: The enrichment approach is designed to intercept the requests from data services. Therefore, a domain ontology is constructed and evolved in accordance with the syntactic representations provided by such services in order to define the data concepts. In addition, a property matching mechanism is proposed to exploit the potential data intersection observed in data service representations and external data sources so as to enhance the domain ontology with new equivalences triples. Finally, the enrichment approach is capable of deriving on demand a semantic description and data representations that link to the domain ontology concepts. Findings: Experiments were performed using real-world datasets, such as DBpedia, GeoNames as well as open government data. The obtained results show the applicability of the proposed architecture and that it can boost the development of semantic data services. Moreover, the matching approach achieved better performance when compared with other existing approaches found in the literature. Research limitations/implications: This work only considers services designed as data providers, i.e., services that provide an interface for accessing data sources. In addition, our approach assumes that both data services and external sources – used to enhance the domain ontology – have some potential of data intersection. Such assumption only requires that services and external sources share particular property values. Originality/value: Unlike most of the approaches found in the literature, the architecture proposed in this paper is meant to semantically enrich data services in such way that human intervention is minimal. Furthermore, an automata-based index is also presented as a novel method that significantly improves the performance of the property matching mechanism. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data service; Ontology alignment and construction; Property matching; Semantic representation; Semantic web service; Service description,Ontology; Semantic Web; User interfaces; Data services; Ontology alignment; Property matching; Semantic representation; Service description; Web services,"Oliveira, B.C.N.; Department of Informatics and Statistics, Brazil; email: bruno.cno@posgrad.ufsc.br",English,Article,Final,Scopus

This study evaluates the associativity between OGD Index (OGD) and the characteristics of those countries as well as to compare the degree of OGD among countries. Accordingly, an advanced discussion to explore how a country’s characteristics affect how that country’s government opens data was presented. Design/methodology/approach: The stakeholder relationships of OGD is analysed with the characteristics of a country. The usage data are compared with the data availability according to nine indicators. These data collected from the statistics and OGDI websites are grouped for comparative statistical analyses based on basic descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance and a regression model with variance inflation faction. Findings: The results 1) revealed the reasons some countries have high-ranking indexes and 2) verified the high index values of countries in terms of their degrees of development. This study, thus, attempted to derive a balanced appraisal of national development and OGD. Research limitations/implications: The study sample is limited only to countries 1) which open the statistical data; and 2) are of uneven population density and development degree. The OGDI is limited to expert evaluation. The score might be vary to experts and users with diverse countries at different evaluation period. The limitations can be attributed to the differences between OGDI and real open levels. These differences might influence the reliability and validity. Practical implications: Government departments with OGD policies provide raw data in various formats and with application interfaces for user access. This study, thus, attempts to derive a balanced appraisal of national development and OGD. The factors that evaluate which types of countries open the level of data are explored. Originality/value: This study establishes stakeholder relationships of OGD and extends to analyse the characteristics of a country and OGD that affect the government data open level. The relationships are evaluated through the OGDI with design score scheme. The measurement results indicated that a country possesses high relation to open data with high DI and nature resource. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data analysis; E-governance; Information technology strategy; National characteristics; Open data; Regression model,analysis of variance; article; data analysis; government; human; information technology; population density; reliability; statistics; validity,"Wen, Y.-F.; Graduate Institute of Information Management, Taiwan; email: yeanfu@mail.ntpu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,Scopus

This paper aims to consider the perspectives of open government and information practitioners in England on the procedural and policy implications of open data across local public authorities. Design/methodology/approach: Using four case studies from different parts of the public sector in England (local government, higher education, National Health Service and hospital trust), the research involved master’s level students in the data collection and analysis, alongside academics, thus enhancing the learning experience of students. Findings: There was little consistency in the location of responsibility for open government data policy, the range of job roles involved or the organisational structures, policy and guidance in place to deliver this function. While this may reflect the organisational differences and professional concerns, it makes it difficult to share best practice. Central government policy encourages public bodies to make their data available for re-use. However, local practice is very variable and perhaps understandably responds more to local organisational strategic and resource priorities. The research found a lack of common metadata standards for open data, different choices about which data to open, problems of data redundancy, inconsistency and data integrity and a wide variety of views on the corporate and public benefits of open data. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to England and to non-national public bodies and only draws data from a small number of case studies. Originality/value: The research contributes to the debate about emerging issues around the complexities of open government data and its public benefits, contributing to the discussions around technology-enabled approaches to citizen engagement and governance. It offers new insights into the interaction between open data and public policy objectives, drawing on the experience of local public sectors in England. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",England; Information management; Open government; Open government data; Public records management,,"Shepherd, E.; Department of Information Studies, United Kingdom; email: e.shepherd@ucl.ac.uk",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Box 4760 Torgarden, Trondheim, 7465, Norway; NTNU, Department of Computer Science, Trondheim, NO-7491, Norway","Open data are increasingly available in amount, but often with unprecise or incomplete description. It is time consuming and difficult to discover relevant datasets. Current open data catalogues provide mostly keyword-based search without the ability to understand the user's intent and the contextual meaning of the datasets. Ontology-based semantic search has been well explored in semantic web as an attempt to improve the quality of search for relevant documents and web pages. This paper applies semantic and machine learning technologies to open data. It presents an approach for search of open government datasets, a relatively underexplored domain, where the semantics of data relies on metadata that describes the data. The idea is to link the published datasets with concepts from a well-defined ontology and allow searching based on hybrid indexing. A simplified ontology for the transport domain is constructed to demonstrate and test the idea. A prototype search engine has been implemented which supports both manual and automatic linking to concepts in the ontology and exploits hybrid indexing based on these linking methods. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied to dataset linking and indexing and enable the independency of the natural language used for describing the datasets. The manual linking of datasets to ontology concepts is intended for domain experts and data publishers, while the automatic linking is based on the provided dataset descriptions. The automatic linking reduces the overhead of manual concepts linking and the dependency on domain experts. Preliminary results have indicated that semantic search based on ontologies is a promising approach to increase search quality and efficiency for open data search. The success of the automatic mechanism does however depend on the quality and comprehensiveness of the dataset descriptions. © 2019 IEEE.",hybrid indexing; ontology; Open government data; search engine; semantic search,Data mining; Government data processing; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Open Data; Search engines; Websites; Automatic mechanisms; Keyword-based search; Machine learning technology; NAtural language processing; Ontology concepts; Open government data; Relevant documents; Semantic search; Semantic Web,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Safarov I.,"Institutional Dimensions of Open Government Data Implementation: Evidence from the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK",2019,Public Performance and Management Review,8,"Utrecht University, Netherlands","This article investigates the institutional dimensions that shape Open Government Data (OGD) implementation in three developed countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Thirty-two expert interviews and document analysis were used to research OGD implementation practices. The results reveal that OGD implementation as such is not enough to ensure the sustainability and success of OGD adoption in a country. Five different dimensions should be distinguished: policy and strategy, legislative foundations, organizational arrangements, relevant skills, public support and awareness. The approach to the institutional dimensions differs between the countries. Centralized OGD governance is shown to yield better results and a higher level of OGD implementation. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, the article introduces institutional dimensions for explaining OGD implementation; second, it presents a comparative analysis of best practices in the three developed countries. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2018, © 2018 Igbal Safarov.",institutional dimensions; open data; open data implementation; open government data,,"Safarov, I.; Utrecht School of Governance, Bijlhouwerstraat 6, Netherlands; email: i.safarov@uu.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Many governments have created and published a huge amount of open data; however, people have a hard time using open data because of data quality issues. The UK, the USA and Korea have created and published open data; however, the rate of open data implementation and level of open data impact is very low because of data quality issues like incompatible data formats and incomplete data. This study aims to compare the statuses of data quality from open government sites in the UK, the USA and Korea and also present guidelines for publishing data format and enhancing data completeness. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses statistical analysis of different data formats and examination of data completeness to explore key issues of data quality in open government data. Findings: Findings show that the USA and the UK have published more than 50 per cent of open data in level one. Korea has published 52.8 per cent of data in level three. Level one data are not machine-readable; therefore, users have a hard time using them. The level one data are found in portable document format and hyper text markup language (HTML) and are locked up in documents; therefore, machines cannot extract out the data. Findings show that incomplete data are existing in all three governments’ open data.

These semantic entities are embedded in a knowledge graph, allowing integration of information from disparate sources under common semantic definitions across spatial and temporal dimensions. Multiple research efforts have contributed to recovering semantics of numeric columns in tables, however they are either restricted to a single domain or rely on the existence of numeric data as linked data tuples in known ontologies.

However, as open data has grown, a critical literature has also emerged which questions who the true beneficiaries of open data are, as well as highlighting the high costs it places on government. Hence systematic research on the actual outcomes of open data projects is urgently needed. This article seeks to explain the factors which promote greater levels of downloads of open government data. We show that the use of profit making datasets far exceeds those which could be used to enhance government transparency or service delivery. We also show that well updated datasets with high quality metadata are more likely to be downloaded. We conclude by supporting currently developing calls for prioritisation in open government data programmes.

García D.R.,"Politics, technology, and accountability: The transparency façade of open government data reforms in Paraguay",2019,eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government,,"reAcción Paraguay, Paraguay","Governments have adopted the rhetoric of promoting transparency, citizen engagement, and accountability through technological innovation. The provision of open government data has been encouraged as a foundational reform in that direction. This study argues that, in Paraguay’s education sector, these reforms were never capable of matching said rhetoric. Using a case study design, the research shows that the stated goals of intuitively simplifying information to facilitate citizen monitoring of funds for education infrastructure were never realistically attempted by the government.

OGD creates value only when the data are analyzed and reused to generate new knowledge. The creation of useful and applicable knowledge is not a simple and permanent thing, as it requires special attention from governments to make the data available and ODE actors to ensure the effective generation of knowledge.

Provenance of open government data (OGD) describes source information related to who, how, where, when and other information over the lifecycle of OGD. Provenance of OGD should be tracked for high-quality and trustworthiness of OGD. Currently, OGD portals provide provenance through general metadata elements, such as creator, provider, creation date, publication date, and issued time. In China, local OGD portals define their own metadata profiles. However, these metadata elements in different OGD portals vary and there is no specific and well-defined provenance description scheme for OGD in China. Therefore, this paper is purposed to survey the current provision situation of provenance metadata elements in 42 China OGD portals and conduct the unification of provenance elements based on the survey results.

The huge part of these published data concern government domain under the notion of Open Government Data “OGD”. This concept aims to expose appropriate information to the government users (citizens, enterprises and public administrations) in various domains (health, economic, etc.). For this reason, a set of datasets has been published through OGD portal. However these datasets couldn’t be efficiently used by OGD portals users that can be citizens or machine. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to study and identify the main problems, which don’t enable using (by citizens) or processing (by machine) efficiently the OGD datasets. To this end, we use Moroccan OGD to extract and illustrate these problems.

Six factors and a ‘perfect storm’; insights from Chicago's food inspection forecasting model,2019,Government Information Quarterly,21,"Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology, Akadeemia Tee 3, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia","It is becoming increasingly clear that the concepts of open government data (OGD) and co-creation are related; however, there is currently only limited empirical material available exploring the link between the two. This paper aims to help clarify the relationship between these two concepts by exploring a recently coined phenomenon: OGD-driven co-created public services. These services 1) utilize or are driven by OGD; 2) are co-created by stakeholders from different groups; and 3) produce public value for society. Due to the relative newness of the phenomenon an inductive exploratory case study is undertaken on Chicago's use of OGD in the co-creation of their food safety inspection forecasting model. This model forecasts critical food safety violations at food serving establishments and sends inspectors to the highest risk establishments first. The results of this exploratory work led to the discovery of a ‘perfect storm’ of six factors that seem to play a key role in allowing OGD-driven public service co-creation to take place. These factors are motivated stakeholders, innovative leaders, proper communication, an existing OGD portal, external funding, and agile development. © 2018 The Authors",Co-creation; Open government data; Predictive analytics; Public service innovation,,"McBride, K.; Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Akadeemia Tee 3, Estonia; email: Keegan.McBride@ttu.ee",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Thus, governments have proposed policies and practices to disclose more data to the public. However, studies have shown the utilization of OGD instead of disclosure as a key problem. Although citizens are recognized as a key participant in the utilization process of OGD from demand-side, few studies have revealed the possible relationship among OGD users, their demands of data and utilization. Therefore, our study carried out a survey on a Chinese population to analyse the possible relationship between these three. Results show citizens’ limited awareness of OGD and portals, and their different demands of OGD subjects due to different socio-demographic characteristics. Daily life and anticorruption were the two main types of OGD utilization by citizens. Their types of usage are affected by their education and knowledge of OGD. Different types of utilization could lead to different demands for OGD subjects. We suggest governments to improve citizens’ awareness of their efforts to provide OGD, and deliver more data in the subject categories that are in greater need by citizens. Further studies need to be carried out on citizens’ motivation of OGD utilization. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data need; Data user; Data utilization; Open government data,Government data processing; Open access; Anti-corruption; Daily lives; Data need; Data users; Data utilization; Demand-side; Open government data; Socio-demographic characteristics; Open Data,"Wang, D.; Wuhan UniversityChina; email: di.wang18@students.mq.edu.au",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Adoption phase is where the organization is in the state of deciding whether to adopt an innovation or not, while the implementation phase is the extent where the innovation is taking into actual use. Taking from the perspective of the central agency who is leading the OGD initiative, by using interview, observation, and desk research as the research approaches, the issues pertaining to OGD implementation is consolidated into the technology-organization-environment framework. The findings have indicated that data granularity, culture, policy, resources, skills, incentives, use and participation, and external pressure are the current issues transpired in the OGD implementation.

Although data, in general, have undoubtedly become an essential resource for the economy, it has remained largely unclear how, or even whether, open data repositories generate any significant value. We addressed this void with a study that examines how sustainable value is generated from open data. Subsequently, we developed a model that explains how open data generate sustainable value through two underlying mechanisms. The first, the information sharing mechanism, explicates how open data are beneficial to forging informational content that creates value for society through increased transparency and improved decision-making. The second, the market mechanism, explicates how open data are beneficial as a resource in products and services offered on the market, as well as how open data are used to make processes more efficient or to satisfy previously unmet needs. We tested and validated the model using PLS with secondary quantitative data from 76 countries. The study provides empirical support to the conjecture that openness of data as well as the digital governance and digital infrastructure in a country have a positive effect on the country’s level of sustainable value.

Our findings reveal that while the barriers to open government information have been substantially reduced, the barriers to open government data persist. Even the most enthusiastic responsible individuals face considerable obstacles in publishing OGD. Further, a key barrier to OGD in the UK is its impression management strategy based on its informational rather than data orientation.

We then examine the portals with regard to updating, reuse, organization and other factors. Of the three cases, Vermont’s portal is moderately successful and continues to be used. New Hampshire’s strategy of linking to data on agency websites is inconsistent, but the state law requiring data published to be in open formats does mean data is more open when it is provided. Maine’s portal went dormant soon after its initial creation, and was fully taken down in the timeframe of this research. These cases illustrate that the establishment of a state portal alone does not guarantee that the portal will support the desired outcomes. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

In this paper a framework for generating smart open linked government data (smart OLGD) is proposed, this framework profits from several technologies, Linked data, Natural language processing to aggregate in a semantic level similar datasets and Ratings-Based Recommender Systems to pro-vide suggestions of datasets that may represent a potential interest for citizens. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Data quality; Dictionary based approach; Health data; Linked data; Natural language processing; Open government data; Recommender systems,Data handling; Government data processing; Large dataset; Linked data; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Semantics; Data quality; Economic development; Government information; Health data; NAtural language processing; Open government data; Service provisioning; Technical competence; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus
Wieczorkowski J.,Open data as a source of product and organizational innovations,2019,"Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE",1,"SGH Warsaw School of Economics, Poland","Open data, in particular Open Government Data (OGD), can be treated as an inspiration and source of innovation in the modern economy. As a result of the ongoing digitization, enterprises and public organizations have more and more available data with huge hidden potential. The openness of the public data on the one hand is associated with the concept of an open government and thus it implements the control aspect of OGD. On the other hand, data openness can stimulate the innovation development and the achievement of economic goals. The open data is used in the development of innovative products, including services and software. It is also applied in the management of organizations by supporting decision making. The aim of the article is to show the business opportunities of sharing OGD in the perspective of product and organizational innovation. The paper presents possible and real innovative products and business models of companies using open data, especially from the public sector. The results of the authors research on the scale and methods of open data sharing in various countries with different maturity levels of the OGD concept were also presented. The analysis includes the biggest European Union countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and Poland) and the USA as leader of this idea. The OGD services in the form of Central Repository for Public Information were compared in terms of the possibility of their re-use. The conclusions result from the research carried out by the author on open data websites, the market as well as literature, including the concepts of: innovation, open data and big data. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

We can find datasets with several attributes associated with specific geographic coordinates, such as open government, meteorological and social network data. The visual exploration of such data facilitates to communicate how different attributes correlate to geographical locations by layering these attributes over maps. However, the analysis and knowledge discovery of several attributes associated with a specific location is not a trivial task. In this scenario, we introduce GeoMultiVis, a set of interactive visualizations that combines multivariate data and geospatial localization. It integrates a map with clustered charts and coordinated multiple views, offering a way to interactively apply different filters and analyze several attributes, updating all the related visual representations. We demonstrate its applicability through three real-cases studies. Our main contribution is the interactive visualizations to support the visual analysis of geospatial multivariate data and its application to real cases, helping to find patterns and insights that could support decisions makers to improve social issues in the future. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

This paper aims to explore the motivations of citizens who engage in open agriculture data hackathons. We conducted a case study and analyzed data collected from 161 participants of 11 farming hackathons held between 2016 and 2018 in the Netherlands. We found that participants of open agriculture data hackathons have different roles, including business developer, concept thinker, data analyst, data owner, developer, manager, marketer, problem owner, and student. Our analysis shows that citizens are predominantly motivated to engage in open agricultural data hackathons as part of their work. Furthermore, developers and problem owners are mainly motivated by fun and enjoyment. This indicates that it is important for open data policymakers and hackathon organizers to consider different approaches based on citizens’ roles when organizing open data hackathons.

The model is supported by its application to multiple interpretative case studies of the Philippine Open Government initiative. It was evidenced that open government data as a technology is subjective—understood and interpreted inconsistently by the government and data users and therefore creates a disconnect between them. Based on the cases presented, it is proposed that a two-way open governance model will be a more effective approach in developing a truly open government. This reinforces the role of user-side stakeholders as they have the interest, expertise, and resources to utilize open data and can therefore build networks with more users within their respective fields that government initiatives may not be able to reach. © 2019, Department for E-Governance and Administration.

In this study, we drew from the existing principles and evaluation methods to develop a User Interaction Framework, with concrete criteria in five dimensions: Access, Trust, Understand, Engage-integrate, and Participate. The framework was then used to evaluate the current OGD sites created and maintained by 34 U.S. municipal government agencies. The results show that, overall, portals perform well in terms of providing access, but not so well in helping users understand and engage with data. These findings indicate room for improvement in multiple areas and suggest potential roles for information professionals as data mediators. The study also reveals that portals using the Socrata platform performed better, regarding user access, trust, engagement, and participation. However, the variability among portals indicates that some portals should improve their platforms to achieve greater user engagement and participation. In addition, city governments need to develop clear plans about what data should be available and how to make them available to their public. © 2018 ASIS&T",,Evaluation methods; Information professionals; Multiple areas; Municipal government; Open datum; User access; User engagement; User interaction; Information services; article; government; mediator; trust,"Zhu, X.; School of Information Sciences, United States; email: xzhu12@utk.edu",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Similarly, in this global movement, both central and local governments of Taiwan have dedicated efforts and resources to establish open data infrastructure. Nevertheless, because of their respective information environments, agencies possess different capabilities of open data implementations, and different outcomes are achieved. Accordingly, this research adopts and refines an open data maturity model from the literature for the assessment purpose. A quantitative approach by using survey is employed to assess the current development and implementation of open data among Taiwan government agencies. The research also attempts to explore whether central and local government agencies possess similar or different capabilities and commitments in implementing open data. It is expected that the research results can provide insights to practitioners for related policy suggestions and resource allocations.

Given the relative scarcity of impact measurement frameworks, a framework is adapted from that of Verhulst and Young [1], as well as the Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework suggested by Stuermer and Dapp [2]. The idea is to trace the developments resultant from the use of open data from various sources, mainly the City of Cape Town’s open data portal. Several activities and developments are identified and classified under a classification scheme adapted from development pathways relevant to a developing country context. The development pathways are identified from literature. After the developments are traced, critical impact analysis is carried out using the SROI framework. The findings suggest that although there are some indications of impact, such impact is only confined to groups with specialised and specific interest in various types of open data. Additionally, awareness of the existence of open data-sets is also minimal, which significantly decreases the likelihood of use, ergo, impact. Policy suggestions to increase likelihood of use and impact are then presented. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.",Development pathways; Impact measurement; Open data; Social return on investment; Sustainable development goals; Tracing development,Developing countries; Profitability; Social aspects; Classification scheme; Data portal; Development pathways; Impact analysis; Impact measurements; Policy suggestions; Re-turn-on; Tracing development; Open Data,"Van Belle, J.-P.; University of Cape TownSouth Africa; email: jean-paul.vanbelle@uct.ac.za",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Social Media Analytics (SMA) holds the potential to provide a decision making framework that can measure the activities of citizens from social media data and thereby facilitate CzRM. However, the benefits and potential applications of SMA are rarely realised by governments. The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse literature to classify the benefits and applications of SMA as a potential solution for supporting CzRM. Grounded theory was used to identify core categories related to SMA and the relationships between categories. These were then analysed in more detail to compile a classification of six main categories of benefits of SMA to government, with several related applications. The benefits are 1) improved CzRM and service delivery; 2) improved decision making; 3) transparency, engagement and Open Government Data (OGD); 4) improved data management and quality; 5) data analysis and intelligence; and 6) data value for innovation. The analysis of SMA benefits and applications can be used to assist governments with planning SMA projects and to ensure the greatest opportunity for success. Researchers can use the findings to undergird further empirical research related to SMA particularly in the context of e-participation, decision making in government and CzRM. © The Authors, 2019.

"Konstantinou N., Paton N.W.",Feedback driven improvement of data preparation pipelines,2019,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,"School of Computer Science, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom","Data preparation, whether for populating enterprise data warehouses or as a precursor to more exploratory analyses, is recognised as being laborious, and as a result is a barrier to cost-effective data analysis. Several steps that recur within data preparation pipelines are amenable to automation, but it seems important that automated decisions can be refined in the light of user feedback on data products. There has been significant work on how individual data preparation steps can be refined in the light of feedback. This paper goes further, by proposing an approach in which feedback on the correctness of values in a data product can be used to revise the results of diverse data preparation components. Furthermore, the approach takes into account all the available feedback in determining which actions should be applied to refine the data preparation process. The approach has been implemented to refine the results of of matching, mapping and data repair components in the VADA data preparation system, and is evaluated using deep web and open government data sets from the real estate domain. The experiments have shown how the approach enables feedback to be assimilated effectively for use with individual data preparation components, and furthermore that synergies result from applying the feedback to several data preparation components. © 2019 Copyright held by the author(s).",,Big data; Cost effectiveness; Data warehouses; Pipelines; Cost effective; Data preparation; Data products; Data repairs; Enterprise data warehouse; Exploratory analysis; Real estate; User feedback; Data handling,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The expectation is to increase participation by engaging citizens, non-profit organisations, and companies in reusing Open Data (OD). A potential barrier in the exploitation of OD and engagement of the target audience is the low quality of available datasets [3, 14, 16]. Non-technical consumers are often unaware that data could have potential quality issues, taking for grant that datasets can be used immediately without any further manipulation. In reality, in order to reuse data, for instance to create visualisations, they need to perform a data clean, which requires time, resources, and proper skills. This leads to a reduced chance to involve citizens. This paper tackles the quality barrier of raw tabular datasets (i.e. CSV), a popular format (Tim-Berners Lee tree-stars) for Governmental Open Data. The objective is to increase awareness and provide support in data cleaning operations to both PAs to produce better quality Open Data and non-technical data consumers to reuse datasets. DataChecker is an open source and modular JavaScript library shared with community and available on GitHub that takes in input a tabular dataset and generate a machine-readable report based on the data type inferencing (a data profiling technique). Based on it the Social Platform for Open Data (SPOD) provides quality cleaning suggestions to both PAs and end-users. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Open data; Quality assessment; Type inferencing,Human computer interaction; Information systems; Information use; Trees (mathematics); Data profiling; Data quality assessment; Potential barriers; Quality assessment; Quality issues; Target audience; Technical data; Type inferencing; Open Data,"Pirozzi, D.; Dipartimento di Informatica, Italy; email: dpirozzi@unisa.it",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Sharing government data can, therefore, enhance its value, providing privacy is safeguarded. Open government data can also enhance equity by reducing the information advantage that large businesses increasingly have over smaller competitors and customers. However, there are costs associated with open data. It must be curated and disseminated. Protecting individual privacy may require aggregation or transformation. There are also different ways of sharing data. At its crudest, this may take the form of providing files, in whatever form, on a website. More usefully and at greater cost, sharing data may take the form of machine-readable APIs. Data services also help users draw insights from data, for example by identifying patterns or trends or highlighting the most salient information. These different sharing models incur different costs to government and users. More accessible data with associated services generally increase the potential benefits to users but will come at some cost to government. From an economic perspective, it will be more efficient if this is done once by the government. However, given the limited budget resources of governments it is worth considering how the process of opening government data could be optimized. The objective of this research is to provide a framework to assist decision-makers responsible for open data. A data prioritization index could assess the trade-offs between the costs and benefits of making particular datasets open. The benefits depend on the extent to which data are likely to be used by citizens, or to enhance competition among firms. The costs include the ICT infrastructure requirements and privacy safeguards needed to make the data open. Ultimately the value of open data will grow as artificial intelligence lowers the cost of drawing insights from it. Open data could also reduce the extent to which a small number of large companies are able to profit from monopolizing their data holdings. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Economics; Open Data; Value of Data,Budget control; Competition; Costs; Data privacy; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Costs and benefits; Data prioritization; Economic perspective; ICT infrastructures; Individual privacy; Large companies; Potential benefits; Value of Data; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The answer to these demands has been an increasing number of governments and institutions planning, designing and implementing data management and publication projects without enough knowledge of methodologies and experience to carry out the planning of this type of project. Therefore, many methodologies and architectures for the implementation of open government platforms have emerged, but there is still a need to have guidelines that combines management, political and technical aspects. Consequently, this paper proposes a project planning guide to carry out the preparation and publication of government data considering the main technical elements. The preparation of the guide was carried out using as base the evaluation of methodologies, standards and academic references on open government data management.

It utilizes a novel method for extracting semantic representations of legal sources from unstructured formats, such as PDF and HTML text files, interlinking and enhancing them with classification features. At the same time, utilizing the structure and specific features of legal sources, it provides refined search results. Finally, it allows users to connect and explore legal resources according to their individual needs.

This article therefore proposes to increase the intelligence of existing geovisualisations by incorporating five features, to make better use of OGD: (i) automatic geographic data type recognition, (ii) generation of geovisualisation designs, (iii) monitoring of users’ understanding of geographic facts, (iv) self-optimization, and (v) user activity recognition. In addition to benefiting users of OGD, realizing these features presents rich scientific challenges and opportunities for Geovisualization research, the OGD landscape (and beyond). © 2018 held by the owner/author(s).",Adaptive systems; Computer-generated user interfaces; Geovisualisation; Intelligent systems; Open Government Data,Adaptive systems; Information systems; Information use; Intelligent systems; User interfaces; Computer generated; Geo visualizations; Geographic data; Geovisualisation; Open Government Data; Self-optimization; User activity; Geographic information systems,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Mungai P.W.,Causal mechanisms and institutionalisation of open government data in Kenya,2018,Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,5,"University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa","Open data—including open government data (OGD)—has become a topic of prominence during the last decade. However, most governments have not realised the desired value streams or outcomes from OGD. The Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI), a Government of Kenya initiative, is no exception with some moments of success but also sustainability struggles. Therefore, the focus for this paper is to understand the causal mechanisms that either enable or constrain institutionalisation of OGD initiatives. Critical realism is ideally suited as a paradigm to identify such mechanisms, but guides to its operationalisation are few. This study uses the operational approach of Bygstad, Munkvold & Volkoff's six-step framework, a hybrid approach that melds concepts from existing critical realism models with the idea of affordances. The findings suggest that data demand and supply mechanisms are critical in institutionalising KODI and that, underpinning basic data-related affordances, are mechanisms engaging with institutional capacity, formal policy, and political support. It is the absence of such elements in the Kenya case which explains why it has experienced significant delays. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",critical realism; institutionalisation; Kenya Open Data Initiative; open government data,,"Mungai, P.W.; University of Cape TownSouth Africa; email: wandopm@gmail.com",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

This paper aims to reveal how municipality size influences municipalities' motivation perspectives on opening up municipality data. To this end, Q-methodology is used, which is a method that is suited to objectify people's frames of mind on a particular topic. By applying this method to 37 municipalities in the Netherlands, we elicited the motivation perspectives of three main groups of municipalities: (1) advocating municipalities, (2) careful municipalities, and (3) conservative municipalities. We found that advocating municipalities are mainly large-sized municipalities (> 65,000 inhabitants) and a few small-sized municipalities (< 35,000 inhabitants). Careful municipalities concern municipalities of all sizes (small, medium, and large). The conservative municipality perspective is more common among smaller-sized municipalities. Our findings do not support the statement ""the smaller the municipality, the less motivated it is to open up its data"". However, the type and amount of municipality resources do influence motivations to share data or not. We provide recommendations for how open data policy makers on the national level need to support the three groups of municipalities and municipalities of different sizes in different ways to stimulate the provision of municipal data to the public as much as possible. Moreover, if national governments can identify which municipalities adhere to which motivation perspective, they can then develop more targeted open data policies that meet the requirements of the municipalities that adhere to each perspective. This should result in more open data value creation. © 2018 by the authors.",Motivation; Municipality; Open cities; Open data; Open government data; Perspective; Policy; Q-methodology; Size,Public policy; Municipality; Open cities; Open datum; Open government data; Perspective; Q-methodology; Size; Motivation,"Zuiderwijk, A.; Faculty of Technology, Netherlands; email: a.m.g.zuiderwijk-vaneijk@tudelft.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The study adopts fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (AHP-TOPSIS) to weigh the barriers and strategies, and it subsequently involves experts to identify and weigh the barriers and strategies. A case of Indonesia is used to contextualize the study. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected using fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS-based questionnaires given to several government representatives who had been working with data and information. The respondents were given sets of pairwise comparisons of which they were asked to compare the level of importance using one to nine fuzzy numbers between barriers and strategies. The data were then calculated using the fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS formula to obtain each weight of the barriers and strategies. The weight is used to prioritize the barrier and strategies. Findings: In total, five barrier categories in the order of importance, namely, legal and privacy; government culture; social; technical; and economic, were identified from 27 barriers. In total, ten strategies of open government data (OGD) adoption were identified and ranked in the order of importance, and they can be grouped into five priorities. Priority 1 is to involve stakeholders in OGD planning and establish an OGD competence center. Priority 2 is to develop a legal compliance framework. Priority 3 is to adopt OGD gradually. Priority 4 is to create a collaboration feature on the portal for stakeholder communication and raise public awareness of OGD. Priority 5, finally, is to conduct training for government officials, develop standard operating practice for OGD management, use standard data formats and provide metadata. Research limitations/implications: This study provides a perspective from the government’s view. One suggestion for future research is to conduct a study from the public’s perspective to formulate strategies based on the identified citizens’ barriers in using OGD. In addition, cross-country (of different characteristics) studies were required to generalize the findings. Practical implications: The first strategy of the first priority implies that government institutions should be able to develop a preliminary plan to involve relevant stakeholders in OGD planning, which includes identifying relevant stakeholders and continuously engaging them to participate in the planning phase of OGD. The second strategy in the first priority entails that government institutions should realize an OGD competence center by creating a virtual team whose members are from various backgrounds and who are very knowledgeable about OGD and how to manage OGD in government institutions.

Thus, we focus on a core question about analysing and guiding the development of local OGD portals. An evaluation framework is developed based on the comparison of related studies and principles. To fill the gap in existing frameworks which lack clarity in the prioritization process, Analytic Hierarchy Process together with an expert survey is used to derive priorities of elements of the framework. To test the capability of the framework in analysing and guiding the development of local OGD portals, a case study of Chinese province-level OGD portals has been carried out. Results show that data accessibility and quality matter more than data quantity for a local OGD portal. Currently, Chinese province-level OGD portals are in their infancy of development, with a great gap between Taiwan and Hong Kong with other portals. Data relating to local statistics, credit records, and budget and spending are well released on portals in China. Population size and the size and wealth of the local government show no significant relation with the number of datasets. By combining priorities of the framework with evaluation results, it could help local governments to recognise their present shortcomings and give them recommendations for recognizing directions for OGD portal's future development. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Analytic hierarchy process; Data evaluation; Evaluation framework; Local government; Open government data; Open government data portal,,"Wang, D.; School of Information Management, China; email: perditawd@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

This study aims to investigate the motivational factors for adopting OGD among government institutions in Saudi Arabia. A qualitative research approach was used to guide the research and the data was collected using interviews and documentation. The results of the study are interpreted and explained using elements from institutional theory. It shows that the adoption of OGD is influenced by existing institutional arrangements, and that the institutional changes that are occurring in the country such as the Saudi Vision 2030, the approval of the Freedom of information Act 2016, and anti-corruption campaigns have contributed positively to the transition from culture of secrecy to openness. In addition, the initiative is influenced by internal and external institutional pressures. Furthermore, the organizations studied perceived several benefits, which can be described as rationalized myths of the OGD such as transparency and accountability, better access to government data, support for innovation, improved government services, operational benefits and encouragement of participation.

This development has been strongly supported by the evolution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). E.g., it has never been easier to get information through your mobile devices wherever and whenever you want it. Public open spatial data is available in many cities around the world and web-based applications use this data to provide tools and services for many different topics such as traffic information, or the communication of health-related information (e.g. ozone, particulate matter or pollen loads). This paper presents typical problems of such web-applications in terms of application design and implementation and usability evaluation via describing three case study applications which have been developed recently. It tries to answer the question: How can this kind of geo-services be developed and used by scientists to enable public participation within data gathering and urban planning processes? All three applications have the common goal to provide interactive geo-visualization and analysis features which are tailored to support users in their urban planning processes. The innovation of those applications lies in their flexibility regarding the topics they can tackle and their capability to perform interactive analyses triggered by the user. The applications have been built with a strong focus on exploring the available data (e.g. Open Government Data - OGD). Two of the applications have been implemented using the R-Shiny framework, the third application, the smarticipate platform, has been developed using ReactJS for the front-end, running a MongoDB in the background which is fed via a micro-service framework. In the latter application, the users can configure topics, i.e. the platform enables the user to create new services for different planning issues. © Authors 2018.",Geo-visualization; Interactive Web-Applications; R/Shiny Framework; Spatial Decision Support Systems,,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The availability of OGD was encouraged by initiatives for disclosure of data carried out in 2009 by the United States of America and these initiatives were developed in several countries. However, with the amount of public information disclosed by governments, the idea of open content has been increasingly associated to access to information. In Brazil, plans that regard information policies do not establish a standard with guidelines or models for OGD publication. Thus, in the absence of metrics to evaluate the initiatives of data openness by the Brazilian government and its reuse, this article presents the Brazilian metric DGABr, one of the results of a doctoral research. DGABr is a proposed model to evaluate the OGD in the Federal Public Administration of Brazil, based on metrics and international indicators. The experience from other countries regarding OGD evaluation directed the creation of the DGABr; however, Brazil's legislation and information policies had a direct influence on OGD measurements. DGABr is an initial proposal to evaluate Brazil's OGD and their reuse and should evolve with the country's information policy. The proof of concept performed with the metric identified a positive result for the OGD evaluation, allowing validation of the perspectives and dimensions proposed in the metric and its potential reuse indicator. © 2018 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.

Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) provide a key to disclosing the potential of Open Government data, by supplying common terms for marking up metadata and data in a consistent and coherent way. However, quality information is needed to help public institutions decide whether to adopt an existing or newly created CV. The paper discusses how to evaluate and document CV quality thus facilitating a comparison of different controlled vocabularies based on contextual information. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to assess the overall quality and rank of a controlled vocabulary, by integrating various quality dimensions according to the decision maker's needs. A set of e-Government controlled vocabularies that facilitate the semantic interoperability of e-Government data are selected as a testbed, and updated quality values are made available as Linked Data. Multi-step guidelines are also defined promoting and complementing the adoption of W3C recommendations to provide machine-readable quality metadata.

Saxena S.,Asymmetric Open Government Data (OGD) framework in India,2018,"Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance ",4,"Department of Political Science, Central University of Haryana, Mahendragarh, India","Purpose: With the ongoing drives towards Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives across the globe, governments have been keen on pursuing their OGD policies to ensure transparency, collaboration and efficiency in administration. As a developing country, India has recently adopted the OGD policy (www.data.gov.in); however, the percolation of this policy in the States has remained slow. This paper aims to underpin the “asymmetry” in OGD framework as far as the Indian States are concerned. Besides, the study also assesses the contribution of “Open Citizens” in furthering the OGD initiatives of the country. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative following a case study approach informs the present study using documentary analysis where evidentiary support from five Indian States (Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Sikkim and Gujarat) is being drawn to assess the nature and scope of the OGD framework. Further, conceptualization for “Open Citizen” framework is provided to emphasize upon the need to have aware, informed and pro-active citizens to spearhead the OGD initiatives in the country. Findings: While the National OGD portal has a substantial number of data sets across different sectors, the States are lagging behind in the adoption and implementation of OGD policies, and while Telangana and Sikkim have been the frontrunners in adoption of OGD policies in a rudimentary manner, others are yet to catch up with them. Further, there is “asymmetry” in terms of the individual contribution of the government bodies to the open data sets where some government bodies are more reluctant to share their datasets than the others. Practical implications: It is the conclusion of the study that governments need to institutionalize the OGD framework in the country, and all the States should appreciate the requirement of adopting a robust OGD policy for furthering transparency, collaboration and efficiency in administration. Social implications: As an “Open Citizen”, it behooves upon the citizens to be pro-active and contribute towards the open data sets which would go a long way in deriving social and economic value out of these data sets. Originality/value: While there are many studies on OGD in the West, studies focused upon the developing countries are starkly lacking. This study plugs this gap by attempting a comparative analysis of the OGD frameworks across Indian States. Besides, the study has provided a conceptualization of “Open Citizen” (OGD) which may be tapped for further research in developing and developed countries to ascertain the linkage between OGD and OC. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Asymmetry; India; Open citizen; Open data; Open Government Data; States,,"Saxena, S.; Department of Political Science, India; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

For example, if a data scientist performs an analysis in 2017 that saves a significant amount of money, then she will likely to be asked to perform the same analysis on data from 2018. But more data analyses means more effort spent in data wrangling. We introduce the data diff problem, which attempts to turn this problem into an opportunity. Comparing the repeated data samples against each other, inconsistencies may be indicative of underlying issues in data quality. By analogy to text diff, the data diff problem is to find a “patch”, that is, transformation in a specified domain-specific language, that transforms the data samples so that they are identically distributed. We present a prototype tool for data diff that formalizes the problem as a bipartite matching problem, calibrating its parameters using a bootstrap procedure. The tool is evaluated quantitatively and through a case study on an open government data set. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Automl; Data mining; Data wrangling; Sequential analysis,Data mining; Problem oriented languages; Statistical methods; Automl; Bipartite matching problems; Data quality; Data wrangling; Domain specific languages; Multiple data; Prototype tools; Sequential analysis; Metadata,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus
Laboutková Š.,Open government partnership: unutilized potential in post-communist EU members? (Case of the Czech Republic),2018,Innovation,3,"Faculty of Economics, Technical University of Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic","One of the factors that contribute to confining corruption opportunity space is transparent lobbying as part of a broader approach to governance, based on the principles of openness, transparency, participation and disclosure. The problem of lack of transparent lobbying is closely related not only to corruption but to increased inequality of access by voices representative of a wide range of interests to public decision-making. This issue is also one of the relevant issues of Europeanisation that comes to attention in the European public space; lobbying is an important source of information for European decision-making processes, which speaks in favour of creating transparent rules for its functioning. Despite a real reluctance of national political representation to enforce statutory regulation of lobbying there is however a number of factors (besides regulation) that contribute to the transparency of lobbying. One of them is Open Government Partnership initiative which takes a more comprehensive approach to openness via seeking ways to make the government more transparent, responsive, accountable, and effective. The paper focuses on two research questions: Under what circumstances may open government affect the transparency of lobbying and thereby reduce the corruption opportunity space? Does the Czech Republic use the potential of its membership in Open Government Partnership well? The analysis is completed by data from Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania and Slovakia. The performed research uses descriptive, analytic, comparative and interpretive techniques. © 2017, © 2017 The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences.",civil society; Czech Republic; European public space; lobbying; open government; open government data; Open government partnership; Post-communist countries; transparency,civil society; decision making; European Union; governance approach; partnership approach; post-communism; public space; Czech Republic,"Laboutková, Š.; Faculty of Economics, Czech Republic; email: sarka.laboutkova@tul.cz",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Fan Q.,Developing a model for transforming government in the digital age: Local digital government in Australia,2018,International Journal of E-Entrepreneurship and Innovation,,"Western Sydney University, Sydney, Australia","This research reviews digital government development at the local level in Australia and proposes a connected digital government model that aims to transform government and to enable local governments migrate to a higher level of digital government. A framework for developing more connected and responsive digital government at the local level is of paramount importance. Connected government requires not only a user-centric focus for the development of digital services but also government business process integration and a whole of government platform. Information integration, and open government data, reusable services and connected IT architecture are essential characteristics of connected digital government. The proposed model links to third party efforts (intermediaries), which provide more effective ways of developing a more connected digital government by potentially breaking down bureaucratic barriers. As digital technology evolves, people are demanding access to government information and services via various digital channels. The proposed model adopts an integrated multichannel service delivery approach to connected digital governments.

Saxena S.,Open government data (OGD) in six Middle East countries: an evaluation of the national open data portals,2018,"Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance ",5,"Central University of Haryana, Mahendragarh, India","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to do provide an overview of open government data (OGD) frameworks in six Middle East countries (Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Lebanon and Jordan) and to underscore the barriers in using the open data sets. Design/methodology/approach: OGD framework offered by Sieber and Johnson (2015) is deployed for the present purpose. Primarily, documentary analysis is being used for substantiating the study and the national portals of the six countries are investigated. Findings: In line with the frameworks chosen for this study, OGD initiatives across the six Middle East countries are at an emerging phase. All the six countries qualify for the “data over the wall” model as advanced by Sieber and Johnson (2015), wherein there are basic provisions of “data aggregation.” Furthermore, the data are incomplete and outdated, which serve as barriers in using these data sets for analysis and interpretation. Therefore, there are a number of barriers in using the open data sets. However, there are many prospects for using these data sets which would improve public accountability and transparency in the long run. Practical implications: Besides helping in improved decision-making, the governments may be in a better position to appreciate the relevance of adopting a robust OGD initiative in facilitating the economic growth of their country. Social implications: This study is relevant for ensuring that citizen engagement is promoted and there is co-creation of public value. Originality/value: Hitherto, OGD has been investigated in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) but the other countries in Middle East have not been investigated.

Veteran, Malang, Indonesia; Universitas Brawijaya, Malang, Jawa Timur, Indonesia; Department of Management, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Semarang, Jawa Tengah, Indonesia; Department of Management, Universitas Riau, Pekanbaru, Riau, Indonesia","Purpose: Open government data (OGD) is making data available free to all by the government with the aim of ensuring accountability and transparency in government besides generating public value by its usage. OGD is an emerging government initiative in Indonesia and there is potential for harnessing OGD for spearheading innovation and improvising services in different economic sectors. This paper aims to investigate the usage of OGD in the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Documentary analysis was conducted to review the national OGD portal of Indonesia. Structured interviews were conducted with 49 senior management representatives from the private sector and NGOs to solicit their perspectives regarding the usage of OGD for professional purposes. Also, questions were posed regarding the challenges in harnessing OGD for professional purposes. Findings: OGD has immense potential for private sector and NGOs; however, more initiatives are required on the part of the government to open their data sets. Further, involvement of stakeholders from the private sector and NGOs and other interested partners is required for an optimum usage of OGD in different economic sectors of Indonesia. Research limitations/implications: As the research focuses on the private sector and NGOs in Indonesia, the study requires a more broad-based approach to consider the perspectives of different users. Further research is required to appreciate the role of contextual factors in determining the usage of OGD in Indonesia. Originality/value: The study is one of the first to be conducted in Indonesia about the OGD initiatives of the country. Soliciting views from the key management representatives in the private sector and NGOs, the paper contributes to the extant OGD literature, which is more supply-focused and not demand-driven. While conceding that there are ample usages of OGD for the different economic sectors, the paper underlines the need for refining the OGD initiatives of Indonesia. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Indonesia; Open government data; Private sector,,"Solimun, S.; Universitas Brawijaya, Jl.

Saxena S.,Drivers and barriers to re-use Open Government Data (OGD): a case study of open data initiative in Philippines,2018,"Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance ",3,"Central University of Haryana, Mahendragarh, India","Purpose: Given that the Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives of any country are founded on principles of transparency and accountability, it is important that the data sets permit a user-friendly interface for the data sets to be re-used. This paper aims to underline the major drivers and barriers to re-use the data sets in the context of the Philippines. Design/methodology/approach: In line with the model proposed by Sieber and Johnson (2015), the paper invoked an investigation of the national OGD portal of the Philippines following a documentary analysis research approach. Findings: The OGD portal of the Philippines permits data search and sharing via social media. Data sets are available in user-friendly formats with a detailed description of the data set itself in the form of metadata. At the same time, the OGD portal of the Philippines has many barriers to re-use. Data sets are not current, and no attempts have been made at updating the records. While the provision of data mapping is provided, the same is not effective as of now. Conducting statistical analysis is not possible online and some of the links are not active. Finally, users’ suggestions are acknowledged, but the contribution of users toward the existing data sets is not permitted as of now. Research limitations/implications: Given that only a single country’s OGD initiative has been investigated in the study, further research is warranted to undertake a comparative analysis of OGD institutionalization across different countries. Practical implications: Government authorities are encouraged to be more proactive in furthering the OGD initiative. Policymakers and practitioners may appreciate the underlying barriers in re-using the data sets and seek to address these concerns. Originality/value: The OGD initiative of the Philippines has not been investigated so far despite the rising tide of the OGD initiatives across the globe. Given that most of the research on OGD is focused in developed countries, the present study seeks to contribute toward the extant literature by investigating the OGD portal of the Philippines and underlining the major drivers and barriers in re-using the data sets available via the portal. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Open Government Data; Philippines,,"Saxena, S.; Central University of HaryanaIndia; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Open data is also linked to smart cities, and hence important in this context, as it is the first step towards public transparency. Despite the wide range of Open Government Data, interpreting such data sets is a non-trivial task, due to the massive amount of raw data. This stimulates the search for techniques and methodologies that allow the interpretation of implicit information and deduction of new knowledge. One of the approaches used for these tasks involves the use of data visualizations. In addition to data visualizations classically used in descriptive statistics for data analysis, such as line or bar charts, many web sites have been used map visualization techniques. This type of visualization is important, since visualization of georeferenced data combined with other types of information can aid its interpretation. However, for data visualization construction on maps, it is necessary that the objects to be visualized are georeferenced. There are standards for turning such data available, however they are diverse, which may make it difficult for a single tool to display views from different sources. This work aims to present a framework that defines data standards for constructing data visualizations on maps of various types. Based on this framework, a tool was implemented to facilitate the creation of different map views, both by developers of open data portals and by users who analyze such data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Information Visualization in Maps; Open Government Data; Transparency,Information analysis; Information systems; Information use; Transparency; Visualization; Data standards; Descriptive statistics; Implicit informations; Information visualization; Map visualizations; Non-trivial tasks; Open Government Data; Public institution; Data visualization,,Portuguese,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

But how is this being approached in Brazil, in the federal, state, and municipal spheres of government? Objective: To find what initiatives are being conducted in Brazil, how open government data is being used, what types of data are most used in studies, and what are the challenges to implement open government data across the country through a systematic review of the literature. At last, based on the difficulties related to open government data, is suggested the first actions that should be taken to solve it. Method: A search on the main repositories to find literature that pertains to Open Government Data initiatives in Brazil, followed by a systematic review and classification of said literature. Results: There are not many research documents available that use open government data in the context of Brazil. Of those that exist, the main area that has studies on involve politicians and their expenses, and also education investments and results of said investments. Other subjects and uses of open government data are shown in this paper as a means to show that the interest in said data is spread across several areas. Conclusion: Many steps need to be done before an effective use of the government open datasets can be made. In most studies analyzed, researchers needed to take a first step of treatment of the data available before effectively using it. This one difficulty, if solved, would make a great impact on the use of government data.

"Purwanto A., Zuiderwijk A., Janssen M.","Citizen engagement in an open election data initiative: A case study of Indonesian's ""Kawal Pemilu""",2018,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,4,"Delft University of Technology, Delft, South Holland, Netherlands","Citizen engagement is key to the successful and sustainable use of Open Government Data (OGD), involving multiple activities ranging from the retrieval and conversion of raw data to OGD based applications, to the use of these applications to solve societal problems. However, there is a lack of insight into what drives citizens to engage in OGD initiatives. Such insight helps inform policymakers in stimulating and improving the engage ability of an OGD program. This study aims to identify factors that influence why citizens engage in OGD initiatives. To attain this objective, we conducted a single case study of citizen engagement in an open election data initiative in Indonesia. Our study shows that social altruism as an intrinsic motivation is a strong driver for citizens to start and continue engaging with open election data. Low data quality appeared not to hinder citizens from engaging in the OGD initiative; in contrast, it can lead to more engagement. Election is typically concerning with political participation, yet trust and political efficacy factors only marginally influenced citizen engagement in our case study. The case shows that, in a time-critical situation where potential social conflicts were seen to threaten the citizens' lives, collective actions are enabled by the availability of OGD. We draw some key lessons learnt for policymakers to enhance OGD engage ability. Further research is needed to examine whether factors found in this particular case also apply in different settings. © 2018 is held by the owner/author(s).",Case study; Citizen engagement; Development; Election; Indonesia; Open data; Open government data,Data handling; Citizen engagements; Development; Election; Indonesia; Open datum; Open government data; Digital storage,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Hence, several countries around the world have issued Freedom of Information (FOI) laws and acts, imposing that city administrations develop their own open data portals to publish local open data. However, many cities, specially in developing countries, lack the financial resources even to invest in basic IT services. These cities quite often do not have qualified people in open data best practices, transparency and IT solutions for constructing these portals, specially the middle and small-sized ones. There are manyworks pointing out guidelines and general problems in open data portals. However, there is a lack of an unified instrument for evaluating and suggesting good practices in constructing open data portals considering both open data portal requirements and FOI access laws and acts. In this work, we propose an instrument for evaluating open data portals that gathers functionalities present in platforms that support open data portals construction and recommendations from FOI access law. Specifically, we used recommendations from Brazilian Information Access Law, as it is an instance of FOI access recommendation.

These machine-readable datasets enable the creation of applications that help the population in several ways, giving them the opportunity to actively participate in governance processes, such as decision taking and policy-making. While the number of open data portals grows over the years, researchers have been able to identify recurrent problems with the data they provide, such as lack of data standards, difficulty in data access and poor understandability. Such issues make difficult the effective use of data. Several works in literature propose different approaches to mitigate these issues, based on novel or well-known data management techniques. However, there is a lack of general frameworks for tackling these problems. On the other hand, data governance has been applied in large companies to manage data problems, ensuring that data meets business needs and become organizational assets.

The Reagan administration and commercial vendors viewed ""value-Added"" software as a proprietary venture that used strict licenses and copyright to wrench profit from government records while closing them off to wide public access. Open data, in contrast, reconciles government transparency with private sector expansion through open licenses and formats. In the rhetoric of open data, the monitory struggles against monopolistic electronic information technologies that took place in the eighties today align with the free market values of innovation and entrepreneurship touted by Silicon Valley. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Open data; Open government; Open systems; Transparency,Public administration; Transparency; Electronic government; Financial sectors; Freedom of Information Act; Government records; Open datum; Open government; Private sectors; Software interfaces; Open systems,"Currie, M.; University of EdinburghUnited Kingdom; email: morgan.currie@ed.ac.uk",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

This is based on the argument that opening up government data has tremendous social, political and economic benefits. However, if data is open in a format that is not useful to data prospects, it is as good as data that is not open at all. Most governments around the world, especially in the developing countries, have concentrated their efforts around transparency in governance as a major reason for open data. They have only succeeded in opening and publishing data on government Web/open data Portals in unstructured formats. This has prevented innovative use and reuse of data by developers/entrepreneurs and the public for good governance, economic, environmental and social development. Also, access to quality and accurate data as well as how to address privacy issues are critical to achieving the promises of OGD. In addition, the institutional politics around data ownership among government agencies and their readiness to open actual data are critical to national OGD portal. This paper develops an integrated Open Government Data model & architecture based on literature reviews of secondary data to address issues around data format, quality, accuracy and ownership. While addressing these challenges, the goal of the architecture is to guide governments in building a sustainable OGD portal with linked data as the output and the highest level of open data format.

Due to the promising nature of e-governance, it appears that identifying the factors that would help facilitate public value of information technology is extremely important. The most important development of e-governance recently is Open Government Data, which provides citizens with the opportunity to access government data freely, conduct value-added applications, provide creative public services, and participate in different kinds of democratic processes. For the development of public value and electronic governance research and national comparison, the framework requires both subject and object data. In this paper, we first develop a public value e-governance evaluation framework and discuss whether open government data, an enabler of transparent, accountable, and effective public administration institutions, can really contribute to the evaluation of e-governance. With a thorough analysis on Taiwan Government open data, we find out that none of the government open data can really contribute to the evaluation of e-governance directly.

This ongoing experience paper gives a brief overview of the major trends of all past ICEGOV editions, based on keywords sets and other information. As expected, initial findings show a consistent dominance of keywords at the core of ICEGOV including “e-government” and “e-governance”. The paper highlights that others have emerged over time, including new phenomena, such as “social media” in 2010, “open government” after 2011, and “open data” or “open government data” from 2012. To better portray the transition of the relative importance of each keyword, a key research index (KRI) inspired by Kwon & Kwon (2017) is employed. The KRI identifies neither a particular grand theme dominating the discussion nor a transition of particular keywords towards a central theme. By contrast, the KRI shows that specific themes have dominated research in particular geographic regions, e.g. “e-democracy” in Europe, “interoperability” in North America, “information sharing” in Europe and Asia, and “public administration” in Africa and South America. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

The basic assumption is that once data are more discoverable, accessible, available in alternative formats, and with licensing schemes that allow free re-use, diverse stakeholders will develop innovative data applications. Despite OGD's potential transformative value, there is limited evidence for such transformation, particularly due to scarce data use, which is partly attributable to the lack of technical skills and user training. To advance the dialogue around methods to increase awareness of OGD, improve users’ skills to work with OGD, and encourage data use, the paper compares and contrasts how three training interventions in Spain, Italy, and the United States have sought to increase awareness of OGD, improve users’ skills and potentially engage them in their use of OGD. We report three main findings. First, introduction and analysis skills are taught in combination to encourage use of open data. Being aware of OGD and its benefits is insufficient to promote use. Second, OGD training seems to be more effective when complemented with knowledge about context and interactions with government. Finally, embedding the training interventions in the specific contexts and considering the unique characteristics, interests, and expectations of different types of users is critical to success. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Citizen engagement; Information literacy; Open government data; Open government data skills; Open government data users; Training programs,,"Luna-Reyes, L.F.; Department of Public Administration & Policy, United States; email: lluna-reyes@albany.edu",English,Article,Final,Scopus

This ambivalent nature of data is reproduced in the rise of the open government paradigm in 2009, during the Obama presidency. Since then, more and more countries have decided to adopt strategic plans for the openness of public sector information, but there is insufficient analysis of the models adopted and the outcomes, especially from a sociological perspective.

In recent years, it is indicated that one of the sources of secondary PM2.5 is the complex chemical reaction between NH3 and air pollutants (VOCs, particulate matter, NOx, SOx). The Committee on Agriculture of FAO indicates that 64% of NH3 emission on the earth surface is derived from stock raising which motivates this study to discuss following two subjects based on Open Government Data. Subject 1 calculates the effect of the controlled air pollutants (VOCs, particulate matter, NOx, SOx) and the quantity of livestock (e.g. pigs, chickens and so on) nearby the air monitoring stations on the annual mean of PM2.5. Subject 2 uses Apache Spark as Cloud computing platform, the air monitoring stations are geographically clustered by K-medoids to calculate the Spearman's correlation coefficient of pollution source and PM2.5 of each cluster. The experimental results show that the monitoring station with more air pollutants and livestock raised nearby has higher annual mean PM2.5 concentration. The results are expected to provide the government bodies to make environmental decisions and the plants and livestock farms to install air monitors to analyze the air quality data. Our ultimate goals are to improve the environment and reduce both the emission of PM2.5 and the probability of getting cardiovascular disease. © 2017 IEEE.",Apache Spark; Cloud Architecture; K-medoids; PM2.5; Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient,Agriculture; Air quality; Ammonia; Cluster computing; Nitrogen oxides; Patient monitoring; Air monitoring stations; Cloud architectures; Cloud computing platforms; Complex chemical reactions; Environmental decisions; K-medoids; PM2.5; Spearman rank correlation; Pollution detection,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

From the diverse end-users' perspective (general public, interest groups, students, other authorities, etc.), access to data requires specific knowledge, methods, and guidance in identifying and using the relevant content. Metadata are a key concept for the description and classification of data and thus also for ensuring their long-term value. We analyze the European Data Portal as well as one national metadatabase (Austrian Data Portal) with regard to aspects such as data search functionality, keyword consistency, spatial referencing, data format and data license information. In both cases, we found extensive inconsistencies and conceptual weaknesses that heavily limit the practical accessibility. The mere presence of metadata is no indicator for the usability of the data. We argue for a better definition and structuring of the interface between the numerous data providers and the metadatabases. © 2018 by the authors.",Metadata quality; Open data access; Open government data,conceptual framework; database; European Union; metadata; software; statistical data; Europe,"Schauppenlehner, T.; Institute of Landscape Development, Austria; email: thomas.schauppenlehner@boku.ac.at",English,Article,Final,Scopus

In Indonesia, the creation and use of OGD have been supported by the government since 2011. However, in contrary, the maturity level of the OGD published on the publishing sites is quite low, scoring only one up to three stars out of the maximum five stars according to the global Five Star Open Data standard. This paper describes a solution for the problem in the form of a semi-automated publishing tool that could be used to advance the current OGD maturity level in Indonesia. Government agencies, represented by their administrators, could use the tool to process their existing data into the more mature ones. The tool would take government data in the form of Excel and CSV files, or in other words 2-star and 3-star respectively, and process them into the maximum 5-star data in various formats. The main framework of the tool is developed based on an existing framework, extended to give more detailed steps and match to the case study at the Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia (Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics). Based on the evaluation, the tool can level up the existing data's maturity level from 2-star and 3-star to the maximum 5-star based on the Five Star Open Data Standard. This promising result encourages the authors to develop the tool even further in another research and the authors have also provided some possible further development based on the result of this work. © 2017 IEEE.",open government; open government data; semi-automated data publishing tool,Engineering research; Software engineering; Stars; Data maturity; Government agencies; Indonesians; Maturity levels; Open data standards; open government; open government data; Semi-automated; Automation,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

In this paper the authors propose a naming scheme based on Web URLs that enables unambiguous naming and linking of datasets and, more importantly, data elements, across the Web. They further describe their ongoing work to demonstrate the implementation and authoritative management of such schemes through a class of web service they refer to as the ""instance hub"". When working with linked government data, provided either directly from governments via open government programs or through other sources, the issue of resolving inconsistencies in naming schemes is particularly important, as various agencies have disparate conventions for referring to the same concepts and entities. Using linked data technologies the authors have created instance hubs to assist in the management and linking of entity references for collections of categorically and hierarchically related entities. Instance hubs are of particular interest to governments engaged in the publication of linked open government data, as they can help data consumers make better sense of published data and can provide a starting point for development of linked data applications. In this paper the authors present their findings from the ongoing development of a prototype instance hub at the Tetherless World Constellation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (TWC RPI). The TWC RPI Instance Hub enables experimentation and verification of proposed URI design schemes for open government data, especially those developed at TWC in collaboration with the United States Data.gov program. They discuss core principles of the TWC RPI Instance Hub design and implementation, and summarize how they have used their instance hub to demonstrate the possibilities for authoritative entity references across a number of heterogeneous categories commonly found in open government data, including countries, federal agencies, states, counties, crops, and toxic chemicals. © 2018, IGI Global.

Such a strategy to publish open data, which are meaningful and valuable, has made available open government data (OGD) that are publicly accessible to everyone. To promote OGD usage, most OGD datasets are published in a tabular form or a CSV spreadsheet format, which can be easily browsed and downloaded by a human user. However, applications of OGD often require data from different datasets to be integrated. This is a challenging and cumbersome task which usually demand huge human effort, especially if metadata as well as data representation and encoding standards are not well defined. With a thorough analysis into Thailand’s OGD (ThOGD) having over thousand datasets, we found that OGD datasets often involve data related to geolocation, places or administrative division. Therefore, using such geodata as potential linking nodes is very attractive. However, this is not an easy task due to data heterogeneity issues. For example, a location might be represented using a geographic coordination system (e.g., latitude and longitude) or an administrative division which could be in a different level from highest to lowest division such as regions, provinces, districts, municipalities, etc.). Moreover, in Thailand geographical regions can be divided differently by different division schemes depending on the application domains, e.g., meteorology, tourism and statistics. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for mapping and linking OGD datasets using geolocation data which could increase OGD usage and promote the development of new services or applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Data integration; Geodata; Linked open government data; Open government data,Geographical regions; Semantic Web; Semantics; Conceptual frameworks; Coordination systems; Data heterogeneity; Data representations; Geo-data; Linked open government data; Open government data; Publicly accessible; Data integration,"Budsapawanich, P.; Asian Institute of TechnologyThailand; email: st115658@ait.ac.th",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

We found that state governments that had adopted OGD policies earlier had active policy entrepreneurs (or lead departments/agencies) responsible for the policy innovation diffusion across the different government departments. We also found that their efficacy ranking was relatively high in terms of OGD portal openness when openness is measured by the greater number of datasets proactively and systematically published through their OGD portals.

Tags are useful to understand the data without actually reading the data and also to search for OGD. However, administrators have to understand the data in detail in order to assign tags. We take two different approaches for giving appropriate tags to OGD. First, we use a multi-label classification technique to give tags to OGD from tags in the training data. Second, we extract particular noun phrases from the metadata of OGD by calculating the difference between the frequency of a noun phrase and the frequencies of single words within the noun phrase. Experiments using 196,587 datasets on Data.gov show that the accuracy of prediction by the multi-label classification method is enough to develop a tag recommendation system.

To this end, this paper describes a case study of distributed service development in the Swedish public transport sector. The contribution to extant research is twofold. Firstly, based on an inductive analysis, three OGD user archetypes are proposed: employees, entrepreneurs and hobbyists. Secondly, the study finds that the significance of distinct innovation barriers varies across phases of the services' lifecycles and depending on the OGD users' motivation, objective, pre-conditions and approach. Drawing on these insights, we propose that OGD initiatives aimed at facilitating outbound OI to a greater extent should address the barriers that appear during diffusion of innovations, the barriers that are not directly related to the OGD provision, and the barriers that are experienced by non-obvious OGD user groups. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

This scenario is seen all over the world, especially in organizations which open data principles are new e.g. local governments. Thus, not effective law enforcement and the lack of openness result in a waste of resources applied to useless publication of documents, making it hard to achieve the benefits of open data. Looking for a way to help government at this hardworking task, this paper proposes a software architecture for structuring information into open data from distributed repositories placed at local governments websites. This work follows Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) methodology, where the requirement analysis for proposed architecture has been conducted based on availability problems occurred in 561 websites from Brazilian cities. The main contribution of this paper is the proposition of an architecture whose dissemination and instantiation will allow society to focus efforts on more important tasks e.g. review data consistency, making it possible in a near future to automatize the structuring process in a way that data can be used for any purpose. © 2018 Andreiwid Sheffer Correa, P.L.P.

Open data can be reused for purposes other than those for which it was created. The real benefit of OGD is the ability to link data from several heterogeneous datasets. Linked Data is a collection of best practices related to the publication and connection of structured data on the Web. The article presents the concept of OGD along with technical aspects of data sharing, formats and the development of linked data. The results of the authors’ research on the scale and methods of OGD provision in different countries were presented. The analysis includes four countries on different levels of open data maturity (USA, UK, Germany and Poland). For this purpose, the portals that perform functions of Central Repository for Public Information in selected countries were compared in terms of the number of datasets, formats of data and the possibility of their reuse. The aim of this paper is to identify the possibilities to create a business model based on open data. With this purpose in mind, available sources and their formats were analyzed. Particular attention has been paid to the issue of linking data, the quality and the value of the datasets. In support of the thesis about large business significance OGD, ideas were presented to use such data in various business models. © 2018, Academic Conferences Limited.

However, scholars have emphasized lack of use as a key problem in the realization of these benefits. Although studies have been carried out to understand decisive factors in OGD utilization from the aspects of either portals or users, they failed to consider the interaction between the two. Therefore, our study carried out an analysis of the interaction between users and OGD portals during users’ data acquisition process from three aspects: data acquisition methods, data quality requirements, and helping functions. We carried out a survey in a Chinese population to collect data for analysis. Results show users’ high acceptance of keyword search as their method for data acquisition through OGD portals but browsing showed higher usage frequency and was a more stable data acquisition behavior. Females show better acceptance of regular recommendations (e.g. RSS) based on their visiting histories than males. Users’ age, education background and occupation affect their demands of different data quality attributes. Our analysis also shows positive relationship between users’ data acquisition habits with their demands of data quality, users’ need of help with their feelings of difficulties in using the portal, and users’ need of help with their demands of data quality. We suggest promoting OGD utilization by offering better helping functions and improving data qualities in future development of OGD portals. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Data acquisition; Data portal; Open government data,Data acquisition; Data reduction; Intelligent systems; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Quality control; Search engines; Acquisition process; Data portal; Data quality; Keyword search; Open government data; Potential benefits; Population statistics,"Wang, D.; Wuhan UniversityChina; email: perditawd@gmail.com",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus
"Vieira D.I., Alvaro A.",A centralized platform of open government data as support to applications in the smart cities context,2018,International Journal of Web Information Systems,3,"Computer Department, Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Sorocaba, Brazil","Purpose: The development of smart cities (SCs) is a costly process as it requires the implementation of physical infrastructure to meet the demand for data collection. On the other hand, there are open government data (OGD) that are open and free, and can be a first step from the current city evolution to SCs at a more affordable cost. However, these data are available in a decentralized way, in different formats and granularities. To date, the authors have not found any literature work that performs the centralization of OGDs on a single platform. The purpose of this paper is provide a centralized OGD platform. Design/methodology/approach: This work investigates the state-of-the-art literature from the OGD, establishes the research question, design and develop the platform for OGD and accomplish the validation of the platform. Findings: Through the validations of the platform, advantages were observed in relation to productivity gain for the development of solutions, in the SC context, using the proposed platform. Research limitations/implications: The data have been collected in a manual way but for future works, the authors will use the web-crawler for the collection of data. Practical implications: One town hall (Sorocaba) is interested in using the platform to analyze the data usage in the simple way and compare with the other nearby towns.

OGD is an emerging government initiative in Pakistan, and there is a lot of potential for harnessing OGD for spearheading innovation and improvising services in different economic sectors. This paper aims to seek to investigate the usage of OGD in private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: Documentary analysis is conducted to review the national OGD portal of Pakistan. Besides, structured interviews were conducted with 49 senior management representatives from private sector and NGOs to solicit their perspectives regarding the usage of OGD for professional purposes. Also, questions were posed regarding the challenges in harnessing OGD for professional purposes. Findings: OGD has immense usage for private sector and NGOs; however, more initiatives are required on the part of the government to open their data sets. Further, involvement of stakeholders from the private sector and NGOs and other interested partners is required for an optimum usage of OGD in different economic sectors of Pakistan. Research limitations/implications: As the research focuses on private sector and NGOs in Pakistan, the study requires a more broad-based approach to take into account the perspectives of different users. Further research is required to appreciate the role of contextual factors in determining the usage of OGD in Pakistan. Practical implications: Government should be more forthcoming in its OGD initiatives and encourage collaboration from citizens, businesses, voluntary organizations and the like. Social implications: Working professionals from different economic sectors should tap OGD for generating value by improvising their services. Originality/value: The study is the first one to be conducted in Pakistan about the OGD initiatives of the country. Soliciting views from the key management representatives in the private sector and NGOs, the paper contributed to the extant OGD literature which is more supply-focused and not demand-driven. While conceding that there are ample usages of OGD for the different economic sectors, the paper underlines the need for refining the OGD initiatives of Pakistan. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.",NGOs; Open data; Open government data; Pakistan; Private sector; Usage,,"Saxena, S.; Department of Political Science, India; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Yet, where OGD figure prominently in the vision of a smart city, OGD are, in fact, scarce. From production and distribution practices to file types, organizational structure, and repositories, large quantities of potential OGD remain as legacy data trapped in incumbent systems. This article confronts the challenges of legacy data through a constructivist analysis of data wrangling (i.e., converting data into useful formats). The analysis illustrates that wrangling legacy data is more than a rote technical activity. Our findings suggest that smart governance in practice depends on the ways in which social, organizational, and institutional strategies cope with technical change. Further, our research demonstrates that wrangling legacy data is not a discrete problem to overcome but an operating condition defining the rapidly changing landscape of smart governance. © 2018, © 2018 Urban Affairs Association.",,,"Clark, J.; School of Public Policy, 685 Cherry Street, United States; email: jennifer.clark@gatech.edu",English,Article in Press,Article in Press,Scopus
Saxena S.,Drivers and barriers towards re-using open government data (OGD): a case study of open data initiative in Oman,2018,Foresight,4,"Department of Political Science, Central University of Haryana, Mahendragarh, India","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to underscore the significance, drivers and barriers towards re-use of open data sets in the context of Oman’s open government data (OGD) initiative. Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative framework, the paper invoked a documentary analysis approach to probe the OGD initiative of Oman. Specifically, the national OGD portal of Oman (https://data.gov.om/) is being investigated in the paper. Furthermore, the paper invokes a theoretical model of “citizen engagement” (“Data over the wall”, “Code exchange”, “Civic issue tracker” and “Participatory open data model”) proposed by Sieber and Johnson (2015) to assess the extent to which open data sets may be re-used. Findings: As per the theoretical model forwarded by Sieber and Johnson (2015), the OGD initiative of Oman is a cusp between “Data over the wall”, “Code exchange” and “Participatory” models. Oman’s OGD initiative facilitates the re-use of the open data sets. However, there are challenges in re-using the open data sets as well. The paper underlines the prospects of better re-use of data sets by institutionalizing the OGD initiative across all administrative levels of the country. Practical implications: This study holds relevance for practitioners and policy-makers in Oman to ensure the re-use of data sets is facilitated for generating public value. Originality/value: Hitherto, research has underlined the significance of launching OGD initiatives in the West but studies in developing countries are few. The present study seeks to plug this research gap by underlining the significance of OGD re-usage in Oman’s context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Oman; Open data,,"Saxena, S.; Department of Political Science, India; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: Basing itself on two OGD models offered by Kalampokis and his colleagues (Kalampokis et al., 2011) and Sieber and Johnson (2015) and the typology of “good” and “bad” data based on factors such as “usability”, “findability” and “understandability”, the study uses a documentary analysis for generating evidences by scanning the websites linked with OGD across the three countries. Following a qualitative methodology, countries shall be classified in terms of these models and the typology depending upon their OGD nature and scope. Findings: OGD adoption in Iran, Lebanon and Jordan is at a nascent stage, and the OGD nature is of the “bad” type. These countries have merely “aggregated data” over their Web interfaces which are incomplete, outdated and do not permit analytics. Besides, there are a number of challenges which need to be overcome for proper OGD adherence. Nevertheless, there are a lot of prospects for harnessing OGD for improved citizen–government interaction by creating a culture of transparency, collaboration and accountability. Practical implications: The study holds immense significance for government bodies to appreciate the potential of OGD which would go a long way to add social and economic value to propel the country’s growth. Originality/value: No study has been conducted so far which compares Iran, Lebanon and Jordan in terms of their OGD policies; this is the main contribution of the study.

However, utilizing open data without proper understanding of potential quality issues carries the risk of undermining the value of the service that relies on public sector information. Instead of establishing a data quality assessment framework this research considers a review of typical open data quality issues and intends to connect them to the causes leading to these various data problems. Open data specific problems are concluded from a case study and then theoretical and empirical arguments are used to connect them to root causes emerging from the peculiarities of the public sector data management process. This way both practitioners could be more conscious about appropriate cleansing methods and participants shaping the data management process could aim at eliminating root causes of data quality issues. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.",Data cleansing; Data quality framework; Open data; Open data quality; Open data reuse; Public procurement; Root cause analysis,Data reduction; Government data processing; Information management; Data cleansing; Data quality; Open datum; Public procurement; Root cause analysis; Quality control,"Csáki, C.; Corvinus University of BudapestHungary; email: Csaki.Csaba@uni-corvinus.hu",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Nevertheless, some potential risks like sensitivity, privacy, ownership, misinterpretation, and misuse of the data result in the reluctance of governments to open their data. At this moment, there is no comprehensive overview nor a model to understand the mechanisms resulting in risk when opening data. This study is aimed at developing a Bayesian-belief Networks (BbN) model to analyse the causal mechanism resulting in risks when opening data. An explanatory approach based on the four main steps is followed to develop a BbN. The model presents a better understanding of the causal relationship between data and risks and can help governments and other stakeholders in their decision to open data. We use the literature review base to quantify the probability of risk variables to give an illustration in the interrogating process.

There are differing perceptions on the urgency and importance of the openness of public health data. It has been established that disease outbreaks such as happened during the Ebola and Zika virus epidemics are indicative of the need for countries to develop a framework that will provide guidance for the management of public health data. Such a framework should ensure that data collected during public health emergencies are accessible to the appropriate authorities and in a form that can help with timely decision-making during such public health crises. In this article, we highlight available open data policies across many countries, including in the Americas. Our analysis shows that there are currently no articulated policy guidelines for the collection and management of public health data across many countries, especially in Latin America. We propose that any national data governance strategy must address potential benefits, possible risks, examples of data that could be shared, and the attributes of such data. Finally, we stress that the key concern in the Americas should be the development of regional frameworks for open data in public health that can be adopted or adapted by each country through appropriate national or subnational policies and strategies. © 2018 Pan American Health Organization.

Premat C.,Can the French Republic Be Digital? lessons from the last participatory experience on the law-making process,2018,Public Administration and Information Technology,1,"Department of Romance Studies, Classics of Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden","A new law on the Digital Republic was voted in France at the end of 2016. It focused on the definition of digital rights, Net neutrality and the idea of a public service of data. The law was coproduced by the citizens as it was possible to amend the bill proposal on the Net. In fact, it was the first time in France that a bill was digitally amended by citizens. The chapter aims at analyzing the participatory method as a law-making option in France. The question is to understand whether or not this participatory method challenges the traditional way of governing in France. Is it the implementation of a citizen control of the law-making process or a single communicative tool? The first part of the chapter describes the relations between the European and the national contexts of this law. The second part of the chapter explains the participatory tool, introduces the actors and analyzes the impact of the method on the law-making process.

Topic modelling, text mining and document analysis methods are used to extract the themes as well as key named entities. The topics are subsequently labeled and with expert guidance, their semantic meaning are provided. The results indicate that the major theme in FOI research borders on issues relating to disclosure, publishing, access and cost of requests.

Models, languages, and tools, that allow obtaining valuable information efficiently, are thus required. Multidimensional data are typically represented as data cubes and exploited using online analytical processing (OLAP) techniques. The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, also denoted QB, is the current W3C standard to represent statistical data on the SW. Given that QB does not include key features needed for OLAP analysis, in previous work we have proposed an extension, denoted QB4OLAP, to overcome this problem without the need of modifying already published data. Once data cubes are appropriately represented on the SW, we need mechanisms to analyze them. However, in the current state-of-the-art, writing efficient analytical queries over SW data cubes demands a deep knowledge of standards like RDF and SPARQL. These skills are unlikely to be found in typical analytical users. Further, OLAP languages like MDX are far from being easily understood by the final user. The lack of friendly tools to exploit multidimensional data on the SW is a barrier that needs to be broken to promote the publication of such data. This is the problem we address in this paper. Our approach is based on allowing analytical users to write queries using what they know best: OLAP operations over data cubes, without dealing with SW technicalities. For this, we devised CQL (standing for Cube Query Language), a simple, high-level query language that operates over data cubes. Taking advantage of structural metadata provided by QB4OLAP, we translate CQL queries into SPARQL ones. Then, we propose query improvement strategies to produce efficient SPARQL queries, adapting general-purpose SPARQL query optimization techniques. We evaluate our implementation using the Star Schema benchmark, showing that our proposal outperforms others. The QB4OLAP toolkit, a web application that allows exploring and querying (using CQL) SW data cubes, completes our contributions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Linked Open Data; Multidimensional Data Modeling; OLAP; Semantic Web,Data warehouses; Geometry; High level languages; Query languages; Analytical queries; Improvement strategies; Linked open datum; Multidimensional data; Multidimensional data modeling; OLAP; On-line analytical processing; Structural metadata; Semantic Web,"Etcheverry, L.; Instituto de Computación, Ave Julio Herrera y Reissig 565, Uruguay; email: lorenae@fing.edu.uy",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The most common means for publishing OGD is usually in forms of datasets made available on OGD catalogs. Although publishing open data as datasets is straightforward and requires minimal technological skills, it is not ideal for the users who want to use the data in a more dynamic fashion. This paper proposes a scalable framework for creating OGD services from OGD catalog. Our framework emphasizes the need to convert existing OGD datasets to RDF data and value-added services that provides more convenient access to the users. Data querying APIs are among the OGD services to promote application development from the OGD datasets. Our framework is unique in that it does not require additional user intervention in the dataset publishing process and hides the complexity of the linked data technology from the data publishers and users. In this framework, the datasets listed in the OGD catalog were collected and validated for its well-formedness of the tabular data. The service building system converted the data to the RDF format and utilized SPARQL query templates in building the OGD services for each dataset. The framework was applied with the datasets on Data.go.th. The results on overall successful conversion rate of the datasets into the OGD services are reported. The case study exemplifies a scalable approach to augmenting access to OGD and provide a first step in moving OGD towards linked data. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Dataset validation; Open government data API; Open government data service platform; RDF dataset generation,Application programming interfaces (API); Data handling; Ecosystems; Linked data; Microcellular radio systems; Semantic Web; Application development; Citizen participation; Data services; Dataset validation; Open government data API; RDF dataset generation; Technological skills; Value added service; Search engines,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

In contrast to the view of big corporations promoting holistic “smart city in a box” solutions, this work proposes that smarter cities can be achieved by combining already available infrastructure, i.e., Open Government Data and sensor networks deployed in cities, with the citizens’ active contributions towards city knowledge by means of their smartphones and the apps executed in them. In addition, this work introduces the main characteristics of the IES Cities platform, whose goal is to ease the generation of citizen-centric apps that exploit urban data in different domains.

One of the ultimate Open Government Data (OGD) goals is to aid developers develop mobile applications that can improve citizen's live and also enhance the country's economy and support smart cities endeavors. Mobile applications form a powerful channel to serve and reach businesses and citizens. The aim of this study was to determine the status of the UAE OGD usability within the mobile application development by reviewing the usability factors to develop mobile application and assess the OGD datasets. An assessment instrument was designed based on the reviewed usability factors, to assess the UAE OGD datasets. From this study it was clear that the major factors in mobile application development usability by OGD are data completeness, data format and support for developers by offering Application Programming Interface (API) and guides, majority of datasets were found to be complete an indication that UAE OGD has a strong point in data completeness. However, the current UAE OGD does not encourage the developers to build mobile applications because of lack of data format support and missing of API and guides.

This article describes two sets of phenomena. First, far from being taken for granted, open data emerge in administrations through a progressive process that entails uncertain collective inquiries and extraction work. Second, the opening process draws on a series of transformations, as data are modified to satisfy an important criterion of open data policies: the need for both human and technical intelligibility. There are organizational consequences of these two points, which can notably lead to the visibilization or the invisibilization of data labour. Finally, the article invites us to reconsider the apparent contradiction between the process of data release and the existence of raw data. Echoing the vocabulary of one of the interviewees, the multiple operations can be seen as a ‘rawification’ process by which open government data are carefully generated. Such a notion notably helps to build a relational model of what counts as data and what counts as work. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",administration; data labour; invisible work; open data; open government; raw data,access to information; France; government; information processing; software; Access to Information; Datasets as Topic; France; Government; Software,"Denis, J.; Centre de sociologie de l’innovation (CSI) i3 CNRS UMR 9217, Écoles des Mines, CSI, 60, boulevard St Michel, France; email: jerome.denis@mines-paristech.fr",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Although various VRE-related initiatives are under development, there is a lack of insight into how VREs support collaborative open data analysis by researchers and how this might be improved, ultimately leading to input for policy making to solve societal issues. This article clarifies in which ways VREs support researchers in open data analysis. Seven cases presenting different modes of researcher support for open data analysis were investigated and compared. Four types of support were identified: 1) ‘Figure it out yourself’, 2) ‘Leading users by the hand’, 3) ‘Training to provide the basics’ and 4) ‘Learning from peers’.

"Mockus M., Palmirani M.",Legal ontology for open government data mashups,2017,"Proceedings of the 7th International Conference for E-Democracy and Open Government, CeDEM 2017",9,"CIRSFID, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy","An important pillar of Linked Open Government Data is to be able to mix datasets by using common ontologies in order to infer new knowledge. The open government datasets to be mashed-up by developers may be subject to distinct licenses, legal notices, terms of use, and applicable law and regulations from multiple jurisdictions. Within this complex ecosystem there is a need to create semi-automatic tools supported by an ontology to help technical reusers of Public Sector Information to utilize datasets according to their intended purpose and in compliance with the legal obligations that govern the rights to reuse the data. Unfortunately, some researchers may avoid considering all the legal frameworks that apply in the domain of Open Government Data and limit their investigation to only the area of licenses. To enable wider, compliant utilisation of mashed-up open data, we have analysed the European Union (EU) legal framework of reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI), the EU Database Directive and copyright framework and other legal sources (e.g., licenses, legal notices, terms of use) that can apply to open government Datasets. From this deep analysis we now model several major concepts in an Ontology of Open Government Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model (OGDL4M). There have been earlier ontologies for creative commons or open licenses, but they did not anticipate the other legal constraints that arise from Open Government regulations. The OGDL4M ontology will be used for qualifying datasets in order to improve the accuracy of their legal annotation. The Ontology also aims to connect each applicable legal rule to official legal texts in order to direct legal experts and reusers to primary sources. This paper aims to present the modules of the OGDL4M ontology in depth and to describe some preliminary evaluation. © 2017 IEEE.",Legal ontology; Licensing of open government data; Open government data mash-up,Ontology; Complex ecosystems; Data mash-up; Government regulation; Legal frameworks; Legal obligations; Legal ontology; Public sector information; Semi-automatic tools; Laws and legislation,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

A significant example is represented by the mandatory data that Italian public administrations (PAs) are required to publish concerning their contracts. Nevertheless, a low quality of data provided by PAs could hamper the prospect of citizen involvement. Goal: Our objective is to define a set of basic metrics for public contracts OGD on the basis of the ISO SQuaRE standards family, with the goal of enabling the automated evaluation of dataset quality. Method: We started with the metrics defined in the ISO 25024 standard and adapted them to the data schema of the OGD under evaluation. We assessed the results by looking at the issues revealed by the metrics applied to the data released by a pool of PAs. Results: We were able to define a set of metrics, and apply them to to the datasets released by 12 distinct organizations. The metrics allowed us to identify several quality issues that limit the reuse of OGD from the citizen perspective. Conclusions: The metrics we develop are able to identify quality issues and are suitable to perform an initial automated assessment of OGD datasets.

These data represent the cross-boundary information sharing practices between governments and the public. Therefore, this paper investigates OGD by following the theory and practice of cross-boundary information sharing. Most of the current studies have focused on OGD platform, whereas this study has focused on individual government departments and datasets. From the perspective of public data users, we constructed an evaluation index to measure OGD quality, which reflected the degree of cross-boundary information sharing between the governments and the public. We specifically concentrated on the external environment of OGD and selected 128 government departments in Shanghai, Beijing, and Wuhan in China as samples. We found that institutional capacity is an important factor for OGD quality of individual government departments. However, technology capacity and organization arrangement demonstrated small significance for OGD quality. The pressure from the public and higher-level government departments can moderate the relationship between institutional capacity and OGD quality. These results can guide governments in prioritizing the improvement of OGD quality and implementing an OGD project. © 2017",Data quality; External pressure; Institutional capacity; Open government data,,"Fan, B.; School of International and Public Affairs, 1954 Huashan Road, China; email: fanbo@sjtu.edu.cn",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Up to now, the OGD literature has focused mostly on the technical side of open data, with little focus on network aspects. We argue that a definition of what an OGD platform is, and what is within its scope, is lacking. In this exploratory article, we use three knowledge epistemologies – cognitivist, connectionist, and autopoietic – as a lens to examine OGD platforms and to define three different platform types. To validate and further enrich the platform types and to identify which types are most prevalent in case study research and which are underrepresented, we performed a literature review of case studies on OGD platforms published in the main e-government outlets between 2009 and 2016. Looking for elements of each OGD platform type in the case study literature resulted in a pressing question for more empirical research focusing on the network aspects of OGD platforms. We also highlighted the underrepresentation of the autopoietic OGD platform type in case study research.

Based on extant literature and insights from domain experts, we identify and describe four dimensions of competitive capabilities required for open data driven organizations. We argue that by implementing the proposed framework, organizations can increase their chances to favorably compete in their respective markets.

Open data is a central aspect of open government collaboration because it fosters exchange and communication between governments and the public. Government organizations that release open data make choices about file formats that have a substantial impact on the potential for collaboration. A file format, such as a document or a spreadsheet, is a constraint on which programs can read the file and what actions a user can do with the file. Overall, we found data.gov formats with limited collaboration potential but files that could be accessed by people with a wide range of skills. The findings are incorporated into suggestions for future iterations of open data policy. The advantages and limitations of using file formats for open data research are considered.

While governments have increasingly adopted the concept of open government data (OGD) for greater government transparency and citizen engagement, the application of the OGD concept to enhancing government budget transparency is understudied. This paper examines online budget transparency innovation in government. First, we develop a normative public value framework for budget transparency. Second, this framework is applied to guide our empirical crosscase analysis of the reported best and worst U.S. state governments regarding the provision of online budget transparency websites. The results of our analysis challenge existing conceptual frameworks for budget transparency, which fail to recognize the important role of citizens in creating greater public value.

To support new datadriven activities and innovations, the development of a national data infrastructure (NDI) is seen as key. The concept of NDI has entered governmental strategic discussions on data as an asset, the role of data infrastructures in innovation and economic activity, and the role of government therein. However, there is a gap between the ambitions as laid out in the strategies and the actual actions taken towards realizing them. To understand this gap and support NDI development, insight is needed in the components and processes of realizing NDI strategies. In this paper, we study NDI strategies 'in action' in the Netherlands and Switzerland using an analytical framework comprising strategies, stakeholders, design, components and governance. Special emphasis is put on the role of government in formulating and implementing strategies. Our cross-case analysis uncovers lessons that seem relevant for NDI development elsewhere, as well as challenges that need to be resolved before NDIs can hope to actually make the impact associated with them. © 2017 ACM.",Data policy; Egovernment; Governance; National data infrastructure; Open government data; Strategic management,Economics; Data infrastructure; e-Government; Governance; Open government data; Strategic management; Planning,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Concerning the unclear relationship between transparency and accountability, this case study first develops the conception of accountability in the context of open government and finds that accountability relates to the organizational need for an assessment of policy goals. This paper then examines the process in which a state health agency implements data visualization tools in an attempt to enhance the outcome of its open data policy goals. Drawing on the results from semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of internal users at the state agency, this case study provides some evidence as to how the gap between transparency and accountability can be closed at the organizational level. It also finds that data intermediaries can help government agencies overcome their resource constraints by critically assessing data usability while providing the technological expertise to align their open data policy goals with user expectations.

These promises hinge on “data intermediaries”: extra-institutional actors that obtain, use, and translate data for the public. However, we know little about why these individuals might regard open data as a site of civic participation. In response, we draw on Ilana Gershon to conceptualize culturally situated and socially constructed perspectives on data, or “data ideologies.” This study employs mixed methodologies to examine why members of the public hold particular data ideologies and how they vary. In late 2015 the authors engaged the public through a commission in a diverse city of approximately 500,000. Qualitative data was collected from three public focus groups with residents. Simultaneously, we obtained quantitative data from surveys. Participants’ data ideologies varied based on how they perceived data to be useful for collaboration, tasks, and translations. Bucking the “geek” stereotype, only a minority of those surveyed (20%) were professional software developers or engineers.

Such systems can use Open Government Data, visualise urban proposals in 3D models and provide automated feedback on the feasibility of the proposals. Using such a system as a communication platform between citizens and city administrations provides an integrated top-down and bottom-up urban planning and decision-making approach to smart cities. However, generating automated feedback on citizens' proposals requires modelling domain-specific knowledge i.e., vocabulary and rules, which can be applied on spatial and temporal 3D models.

Some early episodes of this social movement can be traced to the early 1990s.This paper presents a historical case study of such an OGD episode, a campaign targeted at a government database called JURIS, initiated by OGD advocates in the early 1990s. JURIS was a legal information retrieval system created by the Department of Justice and used by government employees, which contained federal court decisions (or case law), among many other primary legal materials. Public interest groups and small publishers intended to open up the database for public access and data reuse, but their effort failed and eventually led to the shutdown of the JURIS system. This paper provides a detailed account of the history, analyzes the reasons of the failure, and discusses outcomes of the campaign.

Recognizing the importance of availability of open data to its citizen for increased levels of transparency and accountability and to promote higher level of public participation the Government of India under the aegis of National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) initiated Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India to share government data with its citizens. This has built a foundation to create an open data ecosystem in the country. NDSAP was gazette notified on 17th March 2012 mandating the government entities to proactively release their datasets in Open Format. According to the preamble of NDSAP, there has been an increasing demand by the community that data collected with the deployment of public funds should be made more readily available to all, for enabling rational debate, better decision making and use in meeting civil society needs. Implementation of NDSAP through OGD Platform since its Alpha release in 2012 has been increasing the usability and relevance of open government data and sustaining the ecosystem around it. In this paper we are trying to analyze the policy implementation strategy and how that has created a sustainable open government data ecosystem in various sectors. © 2017 ACM.",Data ecosystems; National data sharing and accessibility policy; National informatics; NDSAP; OGD platform; Open data; Open data use license; Open government data; Open government data ecosystems; Open government data platform,Developing countries; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Government data processing; Transportation; Data platform; Data Sharing; Informatics; NDSAP; OGD platform; Open datum; Open government data; Public policy,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus
"Zeleti F.A., Ojo A.",An ontology for open government data business model,2017,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,1,"INSIGHT Centre for Data Analytics, Galway, Ireland","Despite the existence of number of well-known conceptualization in e-Business and e-Commerce, there have been no efforts so far to develop a detailed, comprehensive conceptualization for business model. Current business literature is replete with fragmented conceptualizations, which only partially describe aspects of a business model. In addition, the existing conceptualizations do not explicitly support the emerging phenomenon of open government data - an increasingly valuable economic and strategic resource. Consequently, no comprehensive, formal, executable open government data business model ontology exists, that could be directly leveraged to facilitate the design, development of an operational open data business model. This paper bridges this gap by providing a parsimonious yet sufficiently detailed, conceptualization and formal ontology of open government data business model for open data-driven organizations. Following the design science approach, we developed the ontology as a 'design artefact' and validate the ontology by using it to describe an open data business model of an open data-driven organization. © 2017 ACM.",And business model ontology; E-business ontology; E-commerce ontology; Formal conceptualization; Open data business model; Open data-driven organization; Open government data,Commerce; Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Business modeling; eBusiness; Formal conceptualization; Open datum; Open government data; Ontology,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Governments are generating a huge amount of data spanning different dimensions. This dataification shows the paramount need to identify the means and methods in which the value of data and knowledge can be exploited. While not restricted to the government domain, this dataification is certainly relevant in a government context, particularly due to the large volume of data generated by public institutions. In this paper we identify the various activities and roles within a data value chain, and hence proceed to provide our own definition of a Data Value Network. We specifically cater for non-tangible data products and characterise three dimensions that play a vital role within the Data Value Network. We also propose a Demand and Supply Distribution Model with the aim of providing insight on how an entity can participate in the global data market by producing a data product, as well as a concrete implementation through the Demand and Supply as a Service. Through our contributions we therefore project our vision of enhancing the process of open (government) data exploitation and innovation, with the aim of achieving the highest possible impact. © 2017 ACM.",Data demand; Data supply; Data value chain; Data value network; Exploitation; Impacts; Innovation; Open data; Value creation,Chains; Government data processing; Innovation; Data demand; Data supply; Data values; Exploitation; Impacts; Open datum; Value creation; Mobile telecommunication systems,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

It is therefore, besides making government services online, Digital India Programme of GoI is making concerted efforts towards improving the IT infrastructure and increasing Internet speed and penetration. Most of the websites for Information/Service delivery does not follow the best web practices. It has been observed that majority of Government websites are facing critical problems like missing identity of the website, outdated and irrelevant content and inconsistent presentation and navigation strategy. Above all, websites are also lacking sensitivity towards differently abled section of society who requires careful attention to access the government information and services. These flaws in government web sites are creating hurdle for the citizens to effectively use them. To address and resolve the above mentioned issue, the need of the hour is to build an efficient solution and mechanism. This will ensure effective delivery of information through the websites. In pursuance of the same, a set of guidelines were developed for Indian Government websites with an objective to make the Indian Government websites comply with the essential pre-requisites of UUU Trilogy i.e.; Usable, User-Centric and Universally Accessible and to establish a protocol for any website running under a Government establishment.

To describe and monitor the state of open data in countries and organisations, several open data assessment frameworks were developed. Despite high scores in these assessment frameworks, the actual (re)use of open government data (OGD) fails to live up to its expectations. Our review of existing open data assessment frameworks reveals that these only cover parts of the open data ecosystem. We have developed a framework, which assesses open data supply, open data governance, and open data user characteristics holistically. This holistic open data framework assesses the maturity of the open data ecosystem and proves to be a useful tool to indicate which aspects of the open data ecosystem are successful and which aspects require attention. Our initial assessment in the Netherlands indicates that the traditional geographical data perform significantly better than non-geographical data, such as healthcare data. Therefore, open geographical data policies in the Netherlands may provide useful cues for other OGD strategies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",assessment framework; geodata; Open data; open data governance; open data maturity,,"Welle Donker, F.; Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, PO Box 5030, Netherlands; email: f.m.welledonker@tudelft.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

It is composed of a number of dimensions that can be measured to understand issues possibly arising in the implementation of a policy or of a project targeting a community. Measuring these dimensions is thus highly valuable for policymakers and local administrator, though expensive and time consuming. To address this issue, we evaluated their estimation through a machine learning technique—Random Forests—applied to secondary open government data and determined the most important variables for prediction. We focused on two dimensions: sense of community and participation. The variables included in the data sets used to train the predictive models complied with two criteria: nationwide availability and sufficiently fine-grained geographic breakdown, that is, neighborhood level. Our resultant models are more accurate than others based on traditional statistics found in the literature, showing the feasibility of the approach. The most determinant variables in our models were only partially in agreement with the most influential factors for sense of community and participation according to the social science literature consulted, providing a starting point for future investigation under a social science perspective. Moreover, due to the lack of geographic detail of the outcome measures available, further research is required to apply the predictive models to a neighborhood level. © 2017 Policy Studies Organization",civic participation; e-Government; machine learning; open data; sense of community,,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

This paper presents insights from a qualitative investigation into the City of Vienna, Austria. It demonstrates how the encounter between the city administration and “the open” juxtaposes the decentralizing principles of the crowd, such as transparency, participation, and distributed cognition, with the centralizing principles of bureaucracy, such as secrecy, expert knowledge, written files, and rules. The paper explores how this theoretical conundrum is played out and how senior city managers perceive Open Government in relation to the bureaucratic nature of their administration. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to empirically trace the complexities of the encounter between bureaucracy and Open Government; and second, to critically theorize the ongoing rationalization of public administration in spite of constant challenges to its bureaucratic principles. In so doing, the paper advances our understanding of modern bureaucratic organizations under the condition of increased openness, transparency, and interaction with their environments. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",bureaucracy; democracy; open government; open government data; organization theory; public administration; Vienna,,"Kornberger, M.; EM Lyon, 23 Avenue Guy de Collongue, France; email: kornberger@em-lyon.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The development of these portals has facilitated the retrieval of this kind of data, but they still have significant limitations. One drawback of current portals concerns the resolution of queries with spatial constraints. Many portals solve spatial queries selecting the datasets that contain in their description the place name informed by the user, which can lead to queries with low recall and precision. Aiming to solve these limitations, we propose a new spatial search engine to improve information retrieval in open government data portals. The main contributions of this work are the development of a system that retrieves OGD at the level of resources and the proposition of a ranking metric that evaluates the relevance of each resource retrieved from a query. We validated the proposed search engine using real data provided by the Brazilian open government data portal.

They are motivated by the claim that it will generate economic and social value. However, the success of an OGD initiative will only be realized when OGD is used and when the use results in the creation of public value. Even though a plethora of academic research has examined various aspects of OGD initiatives, the question regarding how OGD generates public value remains unaddressed. This paper aims to develop an OGD success evaluation model that offers a systematic way of understanding how OGD creates public value. For this purpose, we first present and explore public value generation through an OGD initiative in the context of Indonesia's 2014 presidential election. Subsequently, we propose an OGD success evaluation model that explicates how service, information and system quality affect the intention to use OGD and user satisfaction, which in turn lead to the creation of public values. This paper contributes to the literature by applying the Information Systems Success Model of DeLone and McLean in the context of OGD. It extends their model by adding the concepts of social media quality.

"Khayyat M., Bannister F.",Towards a model for facilitating and enabling co-creation using open government data,2017,Information Polity,14,"Trinity College Dublin, Ireland; King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","In recent years there have been initiatives in many countries which seek to encourage and facilitate co-creation using Open Government Data (OGD). This article describes a research project whose objectives were to investigate the factors that contribute to creating a vibrant co-creation ecosystem built around the use of OGD and to build a model which participants can use as a framework for aiding in co-creation processes. To develop this model multiple case studies are used to investigate the nature of co-creation using OGD in the greater Dublin area. The different dimensions of OGD, as perceived by various stakeholders in co-creation projects, are explored with a view to establishing what facilitates co-creation activities. The stakeholders include the OGD publishers (in this case the four local authorities in the greater Dublin area) and various communities and community groups such as academics, volunteers, voluntary organizations as well as a number of government agencies and commercial organizations. Adopting a modified version of Activity Theory (AT) as a framework, the research uses a wide range of data sources including documents, analysis of web sites, participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the latter is carried out using thematic analysis. From these, a model for encouraging, fostering and enabling the development of co-creation projects in local communities is proposed. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Following an empirical investigation among 244 respondents in India, the paper deploys path analysis via LISREL. The conceptual construction of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework is used to assess the behavioral intention to use and accept OGD. Multiple regression analysis informs the relationship of demographic variables with the behavioral intention to use and accept OGD. Findings: Path analysis showed that there is an increased use and acceptance of OGD among the respondents. Multiple regression analysis shows that men are more likely to use open data sets than women. Individual differences are found among the respondents with regard to OGD usage. Thus, while men may tap open data sets in line with their purposes and professional backgrounds, women are likely to tap the data sets even for non-professional purposes. Furthermore, the respondents who are younger in age are more behaviorally inclined to accepting and using OGD than their older counterparts. Practical implications: The Indian government needs to popularize and familiarize OGD initiatives among the people to a greater extent. The utilitarian value of OGD may be provided when data sets are more user-friendly, frequently updated and accurate. This would facilitate in better provision of public services besides appreciating the public sentiment. Further, with increased interaction between citizens and the government, public accountability and transparency may be better realized. Social implications: The study shows that different groups of people are engaging in tapping information through government websites and related portals. Societal influence was found to be an important factor which predicts the acceptance and usage of OGD. An infrastructure can help to enable the use of OGD. Originality/value: Hitherto, studies have focused on OGD initiatives in the developed countries, but extant literature is scarce on developing countries. Therefore, this study seeks to fill the literature gap by probing OGD use and acceptance among different stakeholder groups in India. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Acceptance; India; Open data; Open government data; UTAUT,,"Saxena, S.; Department of Political Science, India; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus
Saxena S.,“Usage by stakeholders” as the objective of “transparency-by-design” in open government data: Case study of Sri Lanka’s open data initiative,2017,Information and Learning Science,6,"Central University of Haryana, Mahendragarh, India","Purpose: While “transparency-by-design” serves as the antecedent of any Open Government Data (OGD) initiative (Janssen et al., 2017), its logical objective would be the extent to which data “usage” is facilitated. This paper aims to underscore the significance, drivers and barriers to ensure “usage” of data sets conceding that re-use of data sets is one of the key objectives of any OGD initiative. Design/methodology/approach: With a documentary analysis approach, the OGD initiative of Sri Lanka is investigated for the present purpose. Furthermore, the theoretical model of citizen engagement in OGD suggested by Sieber and Johnson (2015) is being referred to appreciate the extent to which the usage of data sets is facilitated via the OGD platform. Findings: There are drivers as well as barriers as far as facilitating the usage of the data sets in the Sri Lankan OGD initiative is concerned. For instance, some of the drivers are the provision of suggesting data sets or the possibility of referring to data sets which are historical in nature. However, there are countless barriers to usage than the drivers. For instance, there is absence of metadata in the data sets; the data sets are not updated regularly; there are historical data; the formats of the data sets are limited in nature and are not user-friendly; there is no facility of conducting data visualization or analytics, and there is no collaborative approach towards building further the OGD initiative. Research limitations/implications: As only one case study is probed in the paper, further research is warranted to undertake a comparative approach by taking two or more case studies into consideration. Practical implications: This study holds relevance for Sri Lankan Government and other stakeholders (policy makers, citizens, developers and the like) so far as furthering of user engagement in OGD initiative is concerned. Social implications: Facilitating more usage by citizens would increase their engagement, and they might derive value out of the data sets. At the same time, the government’s objective of ensuring increased usage of the data sets would be better realized. Originality/value: “Transparency-by-design” approach had its focus on the publishing phase of OGD, and this paper seeks to provide its logical conclusion by emphasizing upon “usage by stakeholders” because by opening data sets, the government has the target to ensure that these open data sets are being used and re-used. Therefore, it is the outcome which is being discussed with the support of a case study set in the background of Sri Lanka’s Open Data initiative. Besides, this is the first study which probes the OGD initiatives of Sri Lanka – therein lies the major contribution of the study. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Citizen engagement; Engagement; Open government data; Sri Lanka; Transparency; Usage by stakeholders,,"Saxena, S.; Central Uniersity of HaryanaIndia; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The chapter has the purpose of defining and discussing the circumstances under which the concepts of open government data and open government data portal are operationalized in Turkish context. These circumstances are analyzed by a detailed inspection of a unique local open government data portal in Sahinbey Municipality of Gaziantep province in Turkey, which constitutes the first and only example of an open data portal in Turkey. In addition, a semi-structured interview, based on the literature, was conducted with a representative of the firm responsible for the establishment and management of the portal to gain deeper insights about the open data portal initiative at the local level. Based on this inquiry, we conclude that although the development of an open government data policy and open data portal is in its infancy in Turkey, there is a potential and possibility for a prosperous development and spread of open data portals throughout the country, at least at the local level. However, a structural analysis of e-government and information disclosure policies in Turkey strongly supports the argument that current open government data policies in Turkey inclines to be reactive rather than proactive, suggesting that there is no prospective indication for a proactive policy covering open data and open data portals. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Local governments; Local open data portals; Open data policy; Proactive model; Reactive model; Turkey,,"Karkin, N.; Pamukkale UniversityTurkey; email: n.karkin@tudelft.nl",English,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus

Hurricane Katrina highlighted the lack of information sharing across levels of government and sectors and showed that such gaps in sharing contribute to slower and uncoordinated response and insufficient deployment of resources. The response to Hurricane Sandy was much more effective because of the lessons learned from Katrina about cross-boundary information sharing but problems still existed. The conclusion that more complex and severe incidents require more coordination and information sharing across levels of government and functional agencies makes it increasingly important to increase information sharing capability as part of EM.

Walkable or pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods increase residents' physical activity and decrease the risk and mortality of non-communicable diseases. We examined walkability and the distribution of the rate of outpatients with hypertension in each administrative region in Taiwan and analyzed whether differences in walkability affect the rate of outpatients with hypertension. All data were retrieved from open government data in Taiwan and analyzed using ANOVA and the National Geographic Information System. Regions were divided into four levels, according to the standard deviation of the walkability index. There were significant regional differences in the number of outpatients with hypertension. Regions with the most walkability presented the lowest incidence of outpatients with hypertension, significantly less than incidence in the third and the least walkable regions. Thus, the lack of walkable neighborhoods is an important risk factor for hypertension.

The author posits that open government data (OGD) has a significant role to play in facilitating the economic turnaround of the GCC region, given that OGD promotes innovation and economic growth besides providing avenues for collaboration and participation among different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: Following a structured literature review, the paper scans literature on OGD followed by providing a typology of countries on the basis of their OGD-adherence (“laggard”, “caged”, “forerunner” and “champ”). This is followed by a discussion on the ongoing oil prices’ crisis, and evidentiary support is lent by examples from the OGD portals of each of the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) to provide indicators as to how a robust OGD implementation may support their economic diversification objectives. Findings: Although the present OGD framework of the GCC is relatively weak, it is asserted that OGD has immense potential in facilitating the economic diversification initiatives of the GCC countries. Therefore, the GCC needs to strategize upon institutionalization of their OGD initiatives for realizing their “vision” and goals of economic diversification to result in an economic turnaround effectively. Originality/value: Besides providing a typology of countries as OGD-adherents and categorizing GCC as “forerunner(s)” on the basis of the typology, the originality of the study lies in its attempt to answer the research question: “what is the role of the OGD in facilitating the economic diversification of the GCC?” Conceding that the research on OGD in the GCC context is few and far between, the present study is a significant contribution to the extant literature pertaining to the roll-out of OGD in developing countries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bahrain; Caged; Economic diversification; Forerunner; GCC; Kuwait; Laggard; OGD; Oil prices; Open data; Systematic literature review; Typology,,"Saxena, S.; Department of Political Science, India; email: stuti.razia@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Greece’s strengths in relation to its ability to progress substantially with digitalization lie in its human capital; the broadband penetration and usage; and the research and development output. In contrast, its most important weaknesses are the lack of importance of ICT in the political vision and government agenda; the success of the government in pushing forward the use of ICT; the effectiveness of the judicial system in resolving business conflicts and in resolving regulation disputes; and the ineffectiveness of the public administration. In this chapter, we identify the reasons for this poor performance and attribute them to intrinsic characteristics of the political landscape in Greece, with a view toward formulating proposals for solving inherent, long-lasting problems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Digitalization strategy; Greek government; Ministerial council; Open government data; Public administration,,"Katsikas, S.K.; Center for Cyber and Information Security, Norway; email: sokratis.katsikas@ntnu.no",English,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus

It consists of a generic data model and a series of corresponding generic services, e.g. for the provision of master data, metrics, spatial data, digital assets, metadata, and links between them. The main objectives are the efficient provision of data as well as the use of the same data by a wide range of applications. In addition, the used technologies and services should enable data supplyasopen (government) data or as linked data in the sense of the Semantic Web. In a first version, these services are used exclusively for read access to the data. For this purpose, the data are usually extracted from their original systems, possibly processed and then stored redundantly in powerful backend systems (“Web Cache”). Generic microservices provide uniform REST interfaces to access the data. Each service can use different backend systems connected via adapters. In this way, consuming components such as frontend modules in a Web portal can transparently access various backend systems via stable interfaces, which can therefore be selected optimally for each application. A number of tools and workflows ensure the updating and consistency of the data in the Web Cache.

To perform these tasks, knowledge on the administrative units to which a protected area belongs or to which it is adjacent to is an important aspect. Acquiring this information is especially challenging if protected areas bordering other countries. An approach providing information on administrative units across Europe in a standardised and hierarchical manner is the NUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) and LAU (Local administrative units) system. However, the NUTS and LAU system generally only refers to attribute data providing administrative unit identifier codes and names. NUTS and LAU spatial data can not to be accessed so easy. Here, open data might be an alternative to purchased data. But, which possibilities exist to access open NUTS and LAU spatial data? Which challenges are related to the use of open data sources? This is illustrated by the example of the Balkan Green Belt as part of the European Green Belt. Examination of open data sources holding NUTS and LAU spatial data (e.g. EUROSTAT, national geoportals, Open Street Map, GADM) identified the following challenges in using this data: lack of metadata, no English version available (website, datasets), and the need for extensive data preprocessing.",Administrative units; Modern protected area management; Open government data; Open spatial data; Volunteered geographic information VGI,conservation management; data processing; data set; environmental protection; GIS; greenbelt; Internet; nomenclature; protected area; spatial data; stakeholder; Balkan; Europe; Turkmenistan,"Hennig, S.; Interfaculty Department of Geoinformatrics-Z-GIS, 30 Schiller Street, Austria; email: sabine.hennig@sbg.ac.at",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The risk on privacy violations is a factor that often blocks the publication of data and results in a reserved attitude of governments and companies. Additionally, even published data, which might seem privacy compliant, can violate user privacy due to the leakage of real user identities. This paper proposes a privacy risk scoring model for open data architectures to analyse and reduce the risks associated with the opening of data. The key elements consist of a new set of open data attributes reflecting privacy risks versus benefits trades-offs. Further, these attributes are evaluated using a decision engine and a scoring matrix intro a privacy risk indicator (PRI) and a privacy risk mitigation measure (PRMM). Privacy Risk Indicator (PRI) represents the predicted value of privacy risks associated with opening such data and privacy risk mitigation measures represent the measurements need to be applied on the data to avoid the expected privacy risks.

However, in many cases public agencies confront organizational, structural and cultural challenges when adopting novel technologies. The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges faced by a ministry that is traditionally organized when exploiting LOSD. The preliminary results suggest that major challenges include the absence of a favorable culture and skills mainly related to data governance and software development.

Democratic processes are multifaceted and open data can be used for various purposes, with diverging roles, rules and tools by citizens and public administrators. This study develops a Democratic Activity Model of Open Data Use, which is illustrated by an exploratory qualitative multiple case study outlining three democratic processes: monitorial, deliberative and participatory. We find that each type of democratic process requires a different approach and open data design.

One aspect of data wrangling involves carrying out format transformations on attribute values, for example so that names or phone numbers are represented consistently. Recent research has developed techniques for synthesising format transformation programs from examples of the source and target representations. This is valuable, but still requires a user to provide suitable examples, something that may be challenging in applications in which there are huge data sets or numerous data sources. In this paper we investigate the automatic discovery of examples that can be used to synthesise format transformation programs.

Open data are often associated with realizing ambitions, such as a more transparent and efficient government, solving societal problems and increased economic value. There has been ample literature describing the (potential) benefits of open data. However, to switch to an open data policy may pose a challenge to the business model of National Mapping & Cadastral Agencies (NMCAs), especially if they are required to generate sufficient revenue to cover a substantial part of their operating costs. This research aims to assess the effects of open data policies on the business models of NMCAs and which adaptations have been made to cope with revenue losses due to open data supply. In March and April 2017, we surveyed European NMCAs to find out which strategies NMCAs employ to be able to (re)finance operational costs and to ensure long-term sustainability of (open) data. This report provides the initial outcomes of the survey and will provide an input for a workshop on Sustainable Open Data Business Models for NMCAs, to be held 18-19 September 2017 in Delft, The Netherlands. This workshop will bring together the NMCAs to present and share their experiences of open data and discuss the research results with representatives of academia. © 2017, European Spatial Data Research (EuroSDR).

Particle pollution is known as a serious threat to human health. Along with developments in the use of wireless sensors and the IoT, we propose an architecture that flexibly measures and processes stream data collected in real-Time by movable and low-cost IoT sensors. Thus, it enables a wide-spread network of wireless sensors that can follow changes in human behavior. Apart from stating reasons for the need of such a development and its requirements, we provide a conceptual design as well as a technological design of such an architecture. The technological design consists of Kaa and Apache Storm which can collect air pollution information in real-Time and solve various problems to process data such as missing data and synchronization. This enables us to add a simulation in which we provide issues that might come up when having our architecture in use. Together with these issues, we state reasons for choosing specific modules among candidates. Our architecture combines wireless sensors with the Kaa IoT framework, an Apache Kafka pipeline and an Apache Storm Data Stream Management System among others. We even provide open-government data sets that are freely available. Copyright © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic review of 135 open data articles and 155 accountability articles from the e-government reference library. A multi-stage analysis results in 12 articles which are categorized using Bovens’ (2007) accountability theory of information, discussion and consequences. Conceptual development, using the literature analysis, forms the final section of the paper. Findings: Research demonstrates that a range of open data topics has been advanced. However, just 12 articles exist that simultaneously address open data and accountability theory. Of the total 155 public accountability articles, the preponderant focus is on the information (N = 25) and discussion (N = 7) stages of the accountability process. Just one article focuses on the complete accountability process. To address this problem, the characterization of open (government) data-driven public accountability establishes conceptual crispness and clarity. Originality/value: Public accountability theory on open government has become overshadowed by social and economic value perspectives. This paper clarifies and advances the open data-driven public accountability perspective. It takes stock of public accountability research, delimits the key issues and questions and highlights the next steps needed for developing scholarship. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",E-democracy; E-government; E-participation; Open data; Open government; Public accountability,,"Lourenço, R.P.; Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering at Coimbra (INESC), Portugal; email: ruiloure@fe.uc.pt",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Design/methodology/approach: The authors take a comparative approach, using a set of concepts commonly applied to the three countries to analyze similarities and differences within this group. The authors gathered textual data and information, the searches for relevant documents guided by a set of concepts or criteria that are frequently used in studies of government’s open data readiness assessment. Findings: The authors conclude by focusing on the very different national exigencies that have given rise to open data ecosystems in the three countries, the variations in policy vehicles and implementation schemes that have instantiated open data practices within the three ecosystems and the common challenges that each country faces in institutionalizing OGD programs beyond the tenures of their current executives. Originality/value: OGD is an information policy with near global relevance and increasing application. Practitioners and scholars alike have used the concept of an “ecosystem” to guide their approach to implementing this policy and to theorizing its scope and benefits.

However, despite the significant increase in use of this open data, the open data providers are mostly not aware of their users and the way in which the data is actually re-used. This is rooted in the principle that open data should be free to use without prior user registration in order to avoid any unnecessary barriers for reuse of the data. However, understanding use and user needs of open data is important to improve the provision of open data and the successful implementation of open data policies. We explored the use of log files of the actual use of open data to identify the users and to explore how the open data is being used. By means of a case study in which we apply log file analytics to the Dutch open geographical data portal we show that this approach is promising for analysing open data use. This approach will yield many new insights for open data providers to improve and fine-tune their open data offer and policy makers will be provided with data on actual use to evaluate their open data policies. Our analysis shows that citizens are a much heavier user of open data than currently assumed: citizens as major users of open government data should be taken much more seriously in the demand driven open data policies. We recommend transferring the pilot project into a permanent monitoring instrument for open data use and exploring additional analytics for using the rich data that log files provide for. © The Authors, 2017.",Data analytics; Evaluation of open data; Geographical data portal; Log file analytics; Open data; Open data use,Data analytics; Gaining insights; Geographical data; Log file; Monitoring instruments; Open datum; Pilot projects; Public organisation; Public policy,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The concept of open data is that, without violating privacy and national security, government data should be open, freely used, and redistributed by the public. It is expected that open data can promote transparency of government. In addition, open data has the potential to stimulate economic growth through value-added applications developed by the public, including citizens, private enterprises, and non-profit organizations. In Taiwan, when realizing the importance of open data, Taiwan government has started promoting the related initiatives in both the central government and local governments. In this research field, most studies have focused on the central government level, on the discussions of the types of open data to be released, and on the promotion of open data activities. Nevertheless, there is still limited research discussing the determinants of open government data, particularly there is a lack from the perspective of local governments. In order to fill this gap, this study explores the determinants of open data by selecting Taichung City Government as a case study. Specifically, this study attempts to identify the factors influencing government agencies' intentions of open data participation. The influential factors are explored from four perspectives: technology, organization, legislation and policy, and environment. In the technological perspective, the identified factors are information system operation, data type, and data format. Second, in the organizational perspective, the influential factors are top management support, cost and benefit, budget and resource, and performance evaluation. Third, legislation and policy is found to have the most significant impact on government agencies. Fourth, in the perspective of environment, both social pressure and peer effect are found to be the influential factors. Lastly, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed in the study.",E-government; Information sharing; Open data; Open government,,"Yang, T.-M.; Department of Library and Information Science, Taiwan; email: tmyang@ntu.edu.tw",English; Chinese,Article,Final,Scopus

While OGD intervenes in political spaces and interests related to transparency agendas, little attention has been paid to the influence of existing transparency initiatives on the way OGD initiatives are designed and implemented. This paper analyzes the influence of the transparency agenda on OGD in order to understand how past decisions in transparency shape current OGD implementation. Based on the case of Chile, the paper follows a historical institutionalism approach: recent transparency-related institutions are analyzed through the lens of path dependence. The paper concludes that existing cultures around the transparency agenda in Chile have both an ideological and operational influence on the development of OGD, which have limited its institutionalization and appropriateness within the public sector to date. © 2016 IEEE.",Chile; open government data; path dependence; political institutions; transparency,Chile; nocv2; open government data; Path dependence; Political institutions; Public sector; Through the lens; Transparency,"Gonzalez-Zapata, F.; Centre for Development Informatics, United Kingdom; email: felipe.gonzalez@manchester.ac.uk",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The most important development of e-governance recently is Open Government Data, which provides citizens with the opportunity to freely access government data, conduct value-added applications, provide creative public services, and participate in different kinds of democratic processes. Open Government Data is expected to enhance the quality and efficiency of government services, strengthen democratic participation, and create interests for the public and enterprises. The success of Open Government Data hinges on its accessibility, quality of data, security policy, and platform functions in general. This article presents a robust assessment framework that not only provides a valuable understanding of the development of Open Government Data but also provides an effective feedback mechanism for mid-course corrections. We further apply the framework to evaluate the Open Government Data platform of the central government, on which open data of nine major government agencies are analyzed. Our research results indicate that Financial Supervisory Commission performs better than other agencies; especially in terms of the accessibility. Financial Supervisory Commission mostly provides 3-star or above dataset formats, and the quality of its metadata is well established. However, most of the data released by government agencies are regulations, reports, operations and other administrative data, which are not immediately applicable. Overall, government agencies should enhance the amount and quality of Open Government Data positively and continuously, also strengthen the functions of discussion and linkage of platforms and the quality of datasets. Aside from consolidating collaborations and interactions to open data communities, government agencies should improve the awareness and ability of personnel to manage and apply open data. With the improvement of the level of acceptance of open data among personnel, the quantity and quality of Open Government Data would enhance as well. © 2016 ACM.",Content Analysis; E-government; Open Data platform; Open Government Data (OGD); Performance Assessment,Function evaluation; Transportation; Content analysis; E-governments; Open datum; Open Government Data (OGD); Performance assessment; Government data processing,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

At the same time citizens expect that these governmental levels adopt a user-centric approach and provide instant access to their data or to open government data. Therefore the applications at various government levels need to be interoperable in support of the 'once only-principle': data is inputted and registered only once and then reused. Given government budget constraints and the cost and complexity of (re)modeling, translating and transforming data over and over, public administrations need to reduce interoperability costs. This is achieved by semantically aligning information between the different information systems of each government level. Semantical interoperable systems facilitate citizen-centered e-government services. This paper illustrates how the Open Standards for Linked Organizations program (OSLO) paved the way bottom-up from a broad basis of stakeholders towards a government-endorsed strategy. OSLO applied a generic process and methodology and provided practical insights on how to overcome the encountered hurdles: political support and adoption; reaching semantic agreement. The lessons learned in the region of Flanders (Belgium) can speed-up the process in other countries that face the complexity of integrating information intensive processes between different applications, administrations and government levels.",Domain Model; E-Government; Interoperability; Public Administration; RDF; Vocabulary,Budget control; Government data processing; Information services; Information systems; Metadata; Public administration; Semantic Web; Semantics; Budget constraint; Domain model; E-government services; E-governments; Integrating information; Interoperable systems; Political support; Vocabulary; Interoperability,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Linked data technologies, on the other hand, aim at transforming data published in web sites into a machine readable format (usually RDF using URIs) in order for them to be linked to other external datasets. Regarding Greek Governmental sites, little work has been done towards this direction. An interesting case is the information provided in the ERMIS Greek portal for Public Administration which involves service provision according to Directive 123/2006/EC. In this paper, we present work performed on the application of linked data technologies on Greek open government data located in the ERMIS Greek Government portal for Public Administration (www.ermis.gov.gr). The focus of the current paper is on the exploitation of the e-GIF ontology, modeling concepts and relations that are used to organize the information appearing in the ERMIS Greek portal for Public Administration using a tool for semantic web applications which is able to transform semantic relations of an ontology into Resource Description Framework (RDF) relationships. The tool not only provides the capability to store, manage and manipulate RDF relations but also to pose queries using SPARQL, an RDF query language. The contribution of the work lies in the fact that, this tool can be incorporated into the ERMIS Greek portal for Public Administration, in order to transform static information appearing in it into linked open data that can be semantically queried.

A better understanding by citizens of what a government does and the level of performance achieved can be better understood by making public sector data open. Citizens can therefore hold their government accountable for not meeting up with stated goals and misconducts. This study employs a survey through content analysis to evaluate the extent of implementation of open data portals. Variables used for the evaluation are Berners-Lee 5 star of open data, implementation technology, data formats, licensing, major data sets and functionality across the African continent. A total of twentytwo data portals from seventeen different countries were assessed. Seven of the data portals representing 32% of the total number of the data portals were implemented using Drupal tool (Dkan). About 60% of the portals under investigation are national initiatives, and Nigeria has the only regional/state initiative and the only two independent organisation data portals. The only two university related-initiatives as well as the only city-based data portal were from South Africa, while a specialised data portal dedicated to the Ebola crisis was captured from Sierra Leone. The dates for the creation of the data portals span from 2011 to the current year (2015). The result indicates that an appreciable effort is being made in the creation of data portals; however, more countries need to take the giant stride to data provisioning in the open formats. More data sets also need to be populated onto the portals. Movement towards attaining the 5- star status of open data portals is in progress but a lot needs to be done towards attaining this. There is also a need to complement the efforts of national governments, and this could be done by regional/state, cities, universities, and independent organisations. © 2016, Archlib and Information Services Ltd.

It examines patterns in both production and scholarly use of National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) publications, using a fixed set of NCHS publications as the benchmark. Of 563 publications issued between January 1, 2010 and August 31, 2015, 168 (29.9 %) were cited at least once between January 1, 2010 and November 1, 2015. There were a total 20,550 cites to NCHS publications with an average 122 cites per publication. Fifty NCHS publications were cited at least 100 times, with Prevalence of Obesity in the United States, 2009–2010 (1669 cites); deaths: final data for 2009 (927 cites); and births: final data for 2007 (809 cites) as the top 3 cited publications. Overall, summary statistics for obesity, birth, and mortality were the most highly cited publications. This study is consistent with a previous citation analysis of federal statistics in identifying mortality as a predominant topic for production and use of NCHS publications. It also highlights several topics, including obesity, that were cited with high frequency compared to their lower publishing coverage. Future studies under this research agenda will investigate non-scholarly uses of government information, and remain focused on government statistics and data. Given trends in open government data, big data, and analytics, government statistics and data has been widely adopted in community activism and data journalism, but such use has yet to be analyzed indepth. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Citation analysis; Government information; Health; Open data; Statistics,,"Das, T.; Social Work Library, 420 W. 118th St., United States; email: tdas@columbia.edu",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Lourenço R.P.,Evidence of an open government data portal impact on the public sphere,2016,International Journal of Electronic Government Research,4,"INESCC, Faculty of Economics, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal","Data portals are being created as part of open government strategies to increase transparency. But although the potential of the internet to increase transparency (as data disclosure) has been widely considered in the literature, there is no reported evidence of any of the released data actually being used by their ultimate recipients (citizens) for public accountability purposes. This descriptive research effort aims to find evidence of the impact of open government portals, asserting whether data is indeed being used and for what purposes. One contract portal was selected and Google Search was used to find portal references on the internet. A qualitative content analysis approach was adopted, whereby references were examined with respect to its main purpose and data usage. Evidence was found of contract data being used, among others, to identify possible situations of corruption, nepotism and misusage of public resources, support argumentation on public policy debates and, in general, to hold public officials accountable in the public sphere through 'blame and shame' sanctions.

Nevertheless, government agencies tend not to open their datasets and can act reluctantly to embed the concept of data publication in their daily operations. Accordingly, this study examines the determinants that are argued to have influences on the government agencies' intention and behavior of open data publication. Relevant hypotheses are developed through literature review to form a preliminary research model, and respective influences of the determinants on the government agencies' intention and behavior to publish datasets are statistically tested. The empirical results show that the determinants account for 60.4% of the variance in agencies' intention and 54.2% of the variance in agencies' behavior. All the determinants are statistically significant except for perceived effort and perceived benefits. Specifically, facilitating conditions and organizational capability are the two factors having the strongest positive effect. Perceived usefulness, external influence, and organizational culture also have positive influences while perceived risks indeed incur a negative impact on the intention. On the contrary, perceived effort and perceived benefits are found to be insignificant. Lastly, intention is statistically significant and indeed acts as a strong antecedent to predict government agencies' activities of open data publication. Practical implications are also offered to practitioners. A designated government agency should act as the coordinator to help agencies obtain facilitations from others. Agencies' concern of data misuse should be mitigated, as it is found to be the major driver having a negative impact. The limitations and future research directions are also discussed.

We examined 269 articles between 2010 and 2015, that were retrieved through keyword searches of the Scopus database and four ICT4D journals. This article adopts the pathway of effects model to analyze contributions according to inputs, mechanisms and outputs of open initiatives in LMICs. The review finds a fairly even spread of articles across the three stages of effects. Studies that disentangled reasons why or why not openness makes a difference provided the most insight to underlying mechanisms and impact of open initiatives. We found very little evidence that research within this area is concerned with the perspectives of poor and marginalized people - notably women. We therefore question the normative value of open development as a means to transform power relations. However, we argue that a more concentrated vision within this field is needed to exploit the full potential of digitally enabled openness for development.",Crowdsourcing; ICT4D research; Open development; Open educational resources; Open government data; Open source software; Peer production,,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

Despite the rapid growth of this multidisciplinary research domain, which has led to the emergence and continuous evolution of technologies and management approaches for open government data (OGD), a detailed analysis of the specific areas and topics of this research is still missing. In this article, a detailed taxonomy of research areas and corresponding research topics of the OGD domain is presented: it includes four main research areas (ODG management and policies, infrastructures, interoperability and usage and value), which are further analyzed into 35 research topics. An important advantage of this taxonomy, beyond its high level of detail, is that it has been developed through extraction and a combination of relevant knowledge from three different sources: important relevant government policy documents, research literature, and experts. For each of the 35 research topics we have identified, its research literature is summarized and main research objectives and directions are highlighted. Based on the taxonomy, an extension of the extant OGD lifecycle is advanced; also, under-researched topics that require further research are identified. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Open government data; open government data interoperability; open government data management; open government data technology; open government data value; research taxonomy,,"Charalabidis, Y.; University of the Aegean, Liberis Building, Greece; email: yannisx@aegean.gr",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Many OGD infrastructures do not stimulate or support OGD use processes, and there is a lack of research regarding which functionalities can stimulate such processes. The objective of this study is to use a design science approach to evaluate whether metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators can improve OGD use. OGD use comprises five main activities, namely searching for and finding OGD, OGD analysis, visualizing OGD, interacting about OGD, and OGD quality analysis. We expect that three OGD key infrastructure elements—metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators—allow for improving these five OGD use activities. A prototype of an advanced OGD infrastructure was created, which implements the three OGD infrastructure elements. Three quasi-experiments with a pretest posttest control group design were conducted. The quasi-experiments showed that the prototype facilitated the usability of the novel OGD use functionalities. Our quasi-experiments supported our propositions that metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators contribute to making OGD use easier and faster, and enhance the user experience. The infrastructure elements improved OGD use by better enabling searching, analyzing, visualizing, discussing, giving feedback on, and assessing the quality of open data. Hence, we plea for integrating metadata, interaction mechanisms, and data quality indicators in open data infrastructures to advance open data usage. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Adoption; design research; e-government; interaction; metadata; open data; open government data; quality; quasi-experiment; social media; usability; use,,"Zuiderwijk, A.; Delft University of Technology, Jaffalaan 5, Netherlands; email: a.m.g.zuiderwijk-vaneijk@tudelft.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

However, evidence from practitioners shows that disclosing data without proper quality control may jeopardize dataset reuse and negatively affect civic participation. Current approaches to the problem in literature lack a comprehensive theoretical framework. Moreover, most of the evaluations concentrate on open data platforms, rather than on datasets.In this work, we address these two limitations and set up a framework of indicators to measure the quality of Open Government Data on a series of data quality dimensions at most granular level of measurement. We validated the evaluation framework by applying it to compare two cases of Italian OGD datasets: an internationally recognized good example of OGD, with centralized disclosure and extensive data quality controls, and samples of OGD from decentralized data disclosure (municipality level), with no possibility of extensive quality controls as in the former case, hence with supposed lower quality.Starting from measurements based on the quality framework, we were able to verify the difference in quality: the measures showed a few common acquired good practices and weaknesses, and a set of discriminating factors that pertain to the type of datasets and the overall approach. On the basis of this evaluation, we also provided technical and policy guidelines to overcome the weaknesses observed in the decentralized release policy, addressing specific quality aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Data quality measurement; Empirical assessment; Government information quality; Open data quality; Open Government Data,,"Vetrò, A.; Nexa Center for Internet and Society, Via Pier Carlo Boggio, 65/A, Italy; email: antonio.vetro@polito.it",English,Article,Final,Scopus
Schrock A.R.,Civic hacking as data activism and advocacy: A history from publicity to open government data,2016,New Media and Society,58,"University of Southern California, United States","The civic hacker tends to be described as anachronistic, an ineffective “white hat” compared to more overtly activist cousins. By contrast, I argue that civic hackers’ politics emerged from a distinct historical milieu and include potentially powerful modes of political participation. The progressive roots of civic data hacking can be found in early 20th-century notions of “publicity” and the right to information movement. Successive waves of activists saw the Internet as a tool for transparency. The framing of openness shifted in meaning from information to data, weakening of mechanisms for accountability even as it opened up new forms of political participation. Drawing on a year of interviews and participant observation, I suggest civic data hacking can be framed as a form of data activism and advocacy: requesting, digesting, contributing to, modeling, and contesting data. I conclude civic hackers are utopian realists involved in the crafting of algorithmic power and discussing ethics of technology design. They may be misunderstood because open data remediates previous forms of openness. In the process, civic hackers transgress established boundaries of political participation. © 2016, The Author(s) 2016.",Activism; hacking; hacktivism; open data; politics; transparency,,"Schrock, A.R.3321 Monogram Ave, United States; email: me@aschrock.com",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Furthermore, the open government and data initiative has led many local authorities to make these datasets publicly available, hoping to drive innovation that will further improve the quality of life for the city-dwellers. In this paper, we develop a novel application that utilizes crime data to provide safe urban navigation. Specifically, using crime data from Chicago and Philadelphia we develop a risk model for their street urban network, which allows us to estimate the relative probability of a crime on any road segment. Given such model we define two variants of the SafePaths problem where the goal is to find a short and low-risk path between a source and a destination location. Since both the length and the risk of the path are equally important but cannot be combined into a single objective, we approach the urban-navigation problem as a biobjective shortest path problem. Our algorithms aim to output a small set of paths that provide tradeoffs between distance and safety. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and their practical applicability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Findings from two empirical case studies in New York and St. Petersburg, Russia produced an improved general model that addresses three questions: How can a given government's open data program stimulate and support an ecosystem of data producers, innovators, and users? In what ways and for whom do these the ecosystems produce benefits? Can an ecosystem approach help governments design effective open government data programs in diverse cultures and settings? The general model addresses policy and strategy, data publication and use, feedback and communication, benefit generation, and advocacy and interaction among stakeholders.

This study examines factors influencing the adoption of OGD among government agencies in Taiwan to fill the existing knowledge gap. Accordingly, based on previous research on innovation adoption, we develop a research model that integrates the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework and the following four factors that are central to adoption decisions: perceived benefits, perceived barriers, organizational readiness, and external pressures. We examined this model through survey data from 342 government agencies of the Executive Yuan in Taiwan. The results show a significant positive relationship among perceived benefits, organizational readiness, and external pressures and the adoption of OGD by government agencies. This study creates a valuable reference for other countries in the early stages of OGD initiatives and has significant implications for governmental policy practitioners. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",External pressures; Open government data; Organizational readiness; Perceived barriers; Perceived benefits,,"Wang, H.-J.; Fo Guang University, No. 160, Linwei Rd., Taiwan; email: hjwang@mail.fgu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,Scopus

In reality much less has been accomplished in practice than advocates have hoped. OGD research to address this gap tends to fall into two streams – one that focuses on data publication and re-use for purposes of innovation, and one that views publication as a stimulus for civic participation and government accountability - with little attention to whether or how these two views interact. In this paper we use an ecosystem perspective to explore this question. Through an exploratory case study we show how two related cycles of influences can flow from open data publication. The first addresses transparency for innovation goals, the second addresses larger issues of data use for public engagement and greater government accountability. Together they help explain the potential and also the barriers to reaching both kinds of goals. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.",Accountability; Ecosystems; Innovation; Open government data; Participation; Transparency,Ecology; Government data processing; Innovation; Transparency; Accountability; Data publications; Exploratory case studies; Open government data; Participation; Public accountability; Public engagement; Social innovations; Ecosystems,"Reggi, L.; Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, United States; email: luigi.reggi@gmail.com",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

It is important to understand what value they create and how, and at the same time – since this is a relatively new type of information systems (IS) – to identify the main improvements they require. This paper contributes in this direction by presenting a methodology for determining the value generation mechanism of open government data (OGD) systems and also priorities for their improvement. It is based on the estimation of a ‗value model‘of the OGD system under evaluation from users‘ratings, which consists of several value dimensions and their corresponding value measures, organized in three ‘value layers‘, and also the relations among them. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied to an OGD system developed as part of the European project ENGAGE (‘An Infrastructure for Open, Linked Governmental Data Provision towards Research Communities and Citizens‘), and provided interesting insights and improvement priorities. This first application provides evidence that our methodology can be a useful decision support tool for important ODG systems investment, management and improvement decisions. © 2016, ComSIS Consortium.

Abdulmuttalib H.,Information extraction and dependency on Open Government Data (OGD) for environmental monitoring,2016,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives",,"Dubai Municipality, GIS Department, Maktoom St., Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Environmental monitoring practices support decision makers of different government / private institutions, besides environmentalists and planners among others. This support helps them act towards the sustainability of our environment, and also take efficient measures for protecting human beings in general, but it is difficult to explore useful information from 'OGD' and assure its quality for the purpose. On the other hand, Monitoring itself comprises detecting changes as happens, or within the mitigation period range, which means that any source of data, that is to be used for monitoring, should replicate the information related to the period of environmental monitoring, or otherwise it's considered almost useless or history. In this paper the assessment of information extraction and structuring from Open Government Data 'OGD', that can be useful to environmental monitoring is performed, looking into availability, usefulness to environmental monitoring of a certain type, checking its repetition period and dependences. The particular assessment is being performed on a small sample selected from OGD, bearing in mind the type of the environmental change monitored, such as the increase and concentrations of built up areas, and reduction of green areas, or monitoring the change of temperature in a specific area. The World Bank mentioned in its blog that Data is open if it satisfies both conditions of, being technically open, and legally open. The use of Open Data thus, is regulated by published terms of use, or an agreement which implies some conditions without violating the above mentioned two conditions. Within the scope of the paper I wish to share the experience of using some OGD for supporting an environmental monitoring work, that is performed to mitigate the production of carbon dioxide, by regulating energy consumption, and by properly designing the test area's landscapes, thus using Geodesign tactics, meanwhile wish to add to the results achieved by many efforts to make OGD useful In General and specifically for Environmental Monitoring purposes.",Environmental monitoring; Geo-design; GEO-knowledge; GIS data; Open government data; Spatial analysis,Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Data mining; Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Information analysis; Information retrieval; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Environmental Monitoring; GEO-knowledge; GIS data; Open government data; Spatial analysis; Monitoring,"Abdulmuttalib, H.; Dubai Municipality, Maktoom St., United Arab Emirates; email: husseinma@dm.gov.ae",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

However, one of the challenges of open government data is to help users understand and retrieve datasets. Particularly, this challenge results from the lack of appropriate metadata schema. Currently, there is very limited research focusing on metadata of open government data. Therefore, the purpose of this research is the construction of metadata schema for open government data in Taiwan, and several frameworks of metadata construction and related influential factors are also taken into consideration in this development process. There are four contributions in this research. First, metadata schemas of different countries, including the U.S., the British, and Canada, are analyzed and compared. Second, various steps and influential factors of metadata construction are discussed to form an integrated perspective guiding the research.

The case of italy,2016,Partecipazione e Conflitto,6,"University of Rome, Sapienza, Italy","The philosophy of Open Government provides a new paradigm of innovation in public admin-istration built around three key words: transparency, participation and collaboration. Greater transparency of information about the PA and its way of working should help to regain public confidence in the institu-tions, motivating people to take a more active part in decision making processes. It should also encourage them to support the institutions by inputting their own knowledge and abilities, consequently engendering a widespread spirit of collaboration between different public authorities and between them and the pub-lic, businesses and non profit organisations, in order to relaunching the economic value of the Public Sec-tor Information (Huijboom, Van den Broek, 2011). The hypothesis behind this contribution, starting from an approach based on an interpretation of significant elements in public action (Moini 2013) and of their conceptual framework (Fischer 2003), is that through which open government, open data, social media, collective intelligence, and connectivity are key words in a new rhetoric of administrative innovation-summed up in the label ''government 2.0''-which refers to a form of public action easily seen to be drawn from the neoliberal paradigm (Jessop, 2002), even though subject to some variegated form at na-tional level. © 2016-University of Salento, SIBA: http://siba-ese.unisalento.it.",Administrative Innovation; Neoliberalism; Open Government Data; Public Action; Public Sec-tor Information,,"Franceschetti, L.; University of RomeItaly; email: Laura.Franceschetti@uniroma1.it",English,Article,Final,Scopus
"Smiraglia R., Park H.",Presentation: Using Korean open government data for data curation and data integration,2016,Proceedings of the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications,,"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, United States","This presentation addresses cultural heritage data-sharing practices through the use of Republic of Korea open government data for data-curation and data integration. Data curation enables datasharing throughout the data management life cycle to create new value for new user needs. Previous studies for cultural heritage data integration have been conducted with the mediation between metadata and ontology. Examples are ontology-based metadata integration in the cultural heritage domain with mediation between Dublin Core (DC) and the meta-level ontology known as the CIDOC CRM (International Committee for Documentation - Conceptual Reference Model) (Stasinopoulou et al. 2007), DCMI type vocabulary and the CIDOC CRM (Kakali et al. 2007), DC metadata and the CIDOC CRM in cultural heritage digital object collections (Koutsomitropoulos, Solomou and Papatheodorou 2009), and between archival metadata such as Encoded Archival Description (EAD) and the CIDOC CRM (Bountouri and Gergatsoulis 2011). A gap remaining from prior studies is that cultural heritage data integration has not been actively studied with an emphasis on knowledge organization and data curation using open government data. Our research employed a visualization phase, in which we used domain analytical techniques to better understand the contents of the population of 375 library-related open government cultural heritage data available at the Korean Open Government Website (http://data.go.kr/). Researchers translated all records from Korean to English. Data were in unstructured and in heterogeneous formats such as file formats, data formats and or web addresses. For data curation and integration, we employed the meta-level ontology known as the CIDOCCRM, which we applied qualitatively to small sets of carefully selected records. This phase was based on an earlier project using a different data-set (Park and Smiraglia 2014), in which cultural disparities between Korean data and the CRM were detected and resolved. Visual mappings are conducted by using the mapped Korean open government data which were in unstructured and heterogeneous formats by using CIDOC CRM version 6.2. The mappings were simple and straight-forward. To map instantiation of records, which is required for data integration, we used FRBRoo (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records - object oriented), an extension of the CIDOC CRM, to map the instantiation of data records in a typical data-sharing scenario. Then, equivalent mapping processes were comparatively tested with visualizations to demonstrate the effective harmonization between the CIDOC CRM and FRBRoo, which enables the integration of metadata and data curation from unstructured and heterogeneous formats. This presentation may contribute to the cross- or meta-institutional integration of curation across institutional boundaries in cultural heritages as an imperative for cultural synergy and the role of information institutions (Smiraglia 2014) with metadata integration.",,Bibliographic retrieval systems; Data visualization; Information management; Life cycle; Mapping; Metadata; Ontology; Population statistics; Societies and institutions; Visualization; Bibliographic records; Data-sharing practices; Encoded archival descriptions; Functional requirement; Government websites; Knowledge organization; Metadata integration; Reference modeling; Data integration,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Open data is often touted as the go-to policy for government to pursue, but the actual returns of following such a strategy remain somewhat illusive and anecdotic. Based on a research project subsidised by the Flemish Department of Mobility and Public Works, this paper presents the results of a market consultation with diverse stakeholders. The goal is to better understand the attitudes, bottlenecks, expectations and requirements related to open data of market stakeholders, so that the government can devise strategies that support sustainable open data initiatives and its policy goals at the same time. The paper offers a framework towards analysing this. It concludes that structural and iterative dialogue is desirable, both from the perspective of the market and government, but that this perhaps obvious key component is often overlooked.

To increase the value and reusability of these datasets, the datasets should be made available in RDF format that can support better data querying and data integration. Our previous work proposed a semi-automatic framework for generating RDF datasets from existing datasets in tabular format. In this paper, we extend our framework to support automatic linking of the RDF datasets. One of the important steps is mapping some literal values that appear in a dataset to some standard URIs. Several previous researches use semantic search API such as DBpedia or Sindice for URI mapping. However, this approach is not appropriate for the datasets of Thailand open data portal (Data.go.th) because there is insufficient data for Thai name entities. In addition, a name may match with more than one URI, i.e. word ambiguity. For example, the name “Bangkok” may match with those referenced by URIs of a province, a hospital or a university. To resolve these issues, our framework proposes that finding semantic types is essential to resolve word ambiguity in retrieving a proper URI for a name entity. This paper presents a framework for finding semantic types and mapping name entities to URIs, i.e. URI lookup. A Name Entity Recognition (NER) technique is applied in finding semantic type of a column in a CSV dataset. The results are used for creating ontology and RDF data that include the URI mappings for name entities. We evaluate two approaches by comparing the performance of a semantic search API, i.e. Wikipedia and the NER technique using some datasets from the Data.go.th website. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Automatic linked dataset creation; Automatic ontology creation; Finding semantic types; Name entity recognition (NER),Data integration; Digital libraries; Mapping; Reusability; Semantics; Automatic linked dataset creation; Automatic linking; Automatic ontology; Data querying; Name entity recognition; Semantic search; Semantic types; Semi-automatics; Semantic Web,"Krataithong, P.; Language and Semantic Technology Laboratory, Thailand; email: pattama.kra@nectec.or.th",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

However, scholarly efforts providing elaborations, rigorous analysis and comparison of open data models are very limited. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on Open Data Business Models (ODBMs) are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of ODBMs which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. This has made the understanding of value creation and exploitation mechanisms in existing open data businesses difficult and challenging to transfer. Following the Design Science Research (DSR) tradition, we developed a 6-Value (6-V) business model framework as a design artifact to facilitate the explication and detailed analysis of existing ODBMs in practice. Based on the results from the analysis, we identify business model patterns and emerging core value disciplines for open data businesses. Our results not only help streamline existing ODBMs and help in linking them to the overall business strategy, but could also guide governments in developing the required capabilities to support and sustain the business models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Business model framework; Business models; Open Data Business Models; Open data industry; Open government; Values disciplines,,"Ahmadi Zeleti, F.; Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Insight Building, IDA Business Park, Lower Dangan, Ireland; email: fatemeh.ahmadizeleti@insight-centre.org",English,Article,Final,Scopus

However, the data are mostly unstructured, and this fact, combined with the size of the database, makes any attempt to analyze it a non-trivial matter. Publishing the Official Gazette as OGD certainly does not address all the problems related to its use, but hopefully barriers can be overcome to allow more groups to make use of it. In this paper, three research methods are combined; a bibliographical review, documentary research, and direct observation. This paper describes the strategies and activities put into effect by a public body and an academic group in preparing the implementation of the open Official Gazette. It also analyses the outcomes of these strategies and activities by examining the tool implemented, the traffic and the reported uses of the Open Gazette.

Open data concept means to unfold data to the public free of charge and free of other constrains. With the increasing calls from people for freedom, democracy and participation, the concept of 'Open Government' emerged. Open government is opening government's data to the public and leaving a room for participation, transparency and collaboration. Jordan has adopted open government initiative since 2011. In this paper, we will investigate the perceptions of Jordanian citizens regarding the major concepts of open government. We have developed a research model based on the literature, and then conducted an empirical test on the model based on citizens' responses to a survey. Results indicated that collaboration and transparency have positive influence on citizen's intentions to use E-government websites, and participation has a negative influence. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Collaboration; E-government; Intention to use; Jordan; Open government; Open government data; Participation; Transparency,,"Abu-Shanab, E.; MIS Department, Jordan; email: abushanab@yu.edu.jo",English,Article,Final,Scopus

No published attempts have been made to determine, collectively, whether World Health Organization (WHO) member states and governments have embraced the promise and effort required to officially share open health data. The observational study will provide evidence that WHO member states individually and collectively have adopted open data recommended principles, providing access to open health data. Methods: Using the WHO list of member states (n=194), the researchers identified the presence of open health data or initiatives. With each country, the following types of official government web pages were recorded: a Ministry of Health web page; a conspicuous link on a government web page to open health data; additional government health web sites; national government-sponsored open data repositories; unique attributes of national health data web sites; and adherence to the principles of open government data for health. A supplemental PDF file provides a representation of data used for analysis and observations. Our complete data is available at: https://goo.gl/Kwj7mb Observations and Discussion: Open health data is easily discoverable in less than one-third of the WHO member states. 13 nations demonstrate the principle to provide comprehensive open data. Only 16 nations distribute primary, non-aggregated health data. 24% of the WHO observed member states are providing some health data in a non-proprietary formats such as comma-separated values. The sixth, seventh and eighth open government data principles for health, representing universal access, non-proprietary formats, and non-patent protection, are observed in about one-third of the WHO member states. While there are examples of organised national open health data, no more than a one-third minority of the world’s nations have portals set up to systematically share open health data. At least 15 WHO member states are observed to not even have a government health ministry representation online. Conclusions: We hope the data collected in our Google Sheet and the discussion provided in this paper will generate international interest and advocacy for open health data. © 2016, Prex S.p.A.

First, a framework of IT, organization and skills capabilities required to innovate with data is derived from literature. Second, a case study including a survey and interview with managers from 12 frontrunners in the Netherlands was conducted. The analysis reveals that skills are valued the highest closely followed by organizational capabilities. Setting up a multi-disciplinary team with motivated employees and giving this team the mandate to experiment with data, is essential when innovating with open data. Theoretically, this study contributes to open data research by offering a new capabilities perspective on the organizational level.

The problems encountered include: insufficient data quality and interoperability, problems regarding governance and motivation, lack of capabilities, and heterogeneous political and ideological agendas. A common open data infrastructure might resolve some of these problems, however, implementing such an infrastructure is a highly complex task. This longitudinal case study of the Danish Basic Data Program (BDP) is intended to improve our understanding of the challenges related to providing open access to government data through open data infrastructure. The BDP aims to improve the quality of selected government data, make them more coherent, and improve accessibility through the implementation of a common data distribution platform. The program is expected to increase government efficiency and stimulate innovation. This case study describes the evolution of the BDP and identifies the main structural elements of an open data infrastructure. Data analysis uncovered four tensions, which are identified as key challenges of an open data infrastructure implementation. These tensions are presented with four suggested governance strategies that were used in the BDP case.

These governments must spend their money wisely in order to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. Although government contracting systems are supposed to be transparent, people may still take advantage of these systems to gain benefits, which leads to high-risk contracts and, sometimes, costly government frauds. Recently, governments in some countries have started open data initiatives in order to make government operations more transparent to their citizens. With the open data, a new type of auditor, called an armchair auditor, could play an important role in monitoring government spending. An armchair auditor could be anyone who has an interest in government expenditures and who usually uses technologies to perform analyses on open data. Few studies have discussed how armchair auditors can better use the open data and what data analytics tools could be applied. To that end, this paper proposes a list of audit apps that could assist armchair auditors in analyzing open government procurement data. These apps could help investigate procurement data from different perspectives, such as validating contractor qualification, detecting defective pricing, etc. This paper uses Brazilian federal government procurement contract data to illustrate the functionality of these apps; however, the apps could be applied to open government data in a variety of other nations. © 2016, American Accounting Association.

The growth of digital information and our increased ability to access it have triggered a change in our way of managing knowledge, for we are no longer just passively consuming information but are also actively creating, reusing, and sharing it for personal purposes (like civil activism or entrepreneurship) or social ones (such as data journalism). In this paper we focus on the right to know, especially as concerns public sector information, analyzing the deep transformation this right has undergone developing into a basic right proper. This evolution has been made possible by two enabling factors: (i) the introduction of new paradigms, such as open government data and (ii) changes in the legal framework. We be investigating in particular the correlation between the freedom of information and open data, considering that if we are to make full use of the right to know in the contemporary setting, we need to reuse data so as to make new knowledge out of them. The method of investigation consist in teasing out what the correlation is, in the Italian and other legal systems, between the freedom of information and open data with particular regard of the synergies and influences between the two phenomena. We discuss the legal issues arising out of that correlation and how it shapes relations between government and the collectivity, as well as how it affects digital rights. © The Authors, 2016.",Freedom of information; Open data; Privacy; Right to know; Transparency,Copyrights; Data privacy; Government data processing; Laws and legislation; Transparency; Data journalisms; Digital information; Freedom of informations; Knowledge society; Legal frameworks; Open datum; Public sector information; Right-to-know; International law,,English,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus
Hunter J.,An ontological framework to support evidence-based policy making using global city indicators,2015,"2015 IEEE 1st International Smart Cities Conference, ISC2 2015",1,"School of ITEE, University of Queensland Brisbane, Australia","The concept of ""evidence-based policy making"" (EBPM) has been gaining currency over the past decade and is being promoted by governments around the world as a mechanism for developing more effective and efficient policies and programs based on scientific evidence. Moreover, the advent of open government data, together with the increasing adoption of indicators and networked, mobile sensors that enable systematic monitoring, is making evidence-based policy-making increasingly viable - particularly within the context of ""Smart Cities"". However, one of the key challenges associated with EBPM is the integration and analysis of a wide range of data and knowledge (including policies, programs, targets, indicators) that are heterogeneous, unstructured and dynamic. This paper proposes a high level ontology that provides a consistent, systematic approach to evidence-based policy making within Smart Cities and helps bridge the gap between the monitoring agencies who generate the indicators and the policy-makers who consume it. The proposed EBPM ontology is evaluated in the context of an environmental case study. Challenges associated with the proposed ontological framework are identified and potential future research directions highlighted. © 2015 IEEE.",adaptive management; eGovernment; evidence-based policy making; ontology; program evaluation,,"Hunter, J.; School of ITEE, Australia; email: j.hunter@uq.edu.au",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

"Gonzalez-Zapata F., Heeks R.",The multiple meanings of open government data: Understanding different stakeholders and their perspectives,2015,Government Information Quarterly,100,"Centre for Development Informatics, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PL, United Kingdom","As a field of practice and research that is fast-growing and a locus for much attention and activity, open government data (OGD) has attracted stakeholders from a variety of origins. They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified. Four different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions. Overall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Chile; Open government data; Perspectives analysis; Stakeholder analysis,,"Heeks, R.; Centre for Development Informatics, United Kingdom; email: richard.heeks@manchester.ac.uk",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open data technologies. However, the actual use of open data technologies has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A modified model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open data technologies. The results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45% of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open data technologies. Except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. Our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open data technologies can be used to stimulate the use of open data technologies. The findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open data technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Acceptance; Adoption; Open data; Open data technology; Open government data; Open public sector data; Use; UTAUT,,"Zuiderwijk, A.; Faculty of Technology, Jaffalaan 5, Netherlands; email: a.m.g.zuiderwijk-vaneijk@tudelft.nl",English,Article,Final,Scopus

The rapid growth of information and communication technologies presents new opportunities for everyday citizens to manipulate, use and disseminate these data in innovative ways. ""Developer challenges"" harness this potential by inviting citizens to experiment, play and develop data-based applications for the public benefit. This chapter explores the evolution of government initiated developer challenges in Australia and uses existing theoretical approaches to assess their impact, benefit and potential to generate value. The authors find that while developer challenges can provide an effective platform for citizen engagement, more attention must be paid to the quality of the data and to the activities carried out after the events finish. Moreover, the authors propose that in order to generate value there needs to be a higher level of involvement from the government with the applications developed during these challenges. There are data in every aspect of our lives, every aspect of work and pleasure, and it's not just about the number of places where data comes, it's about connecting it together. And when you connect data together, you get power in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.

In this context, transparency web sites appear as distributed silos of documents with heterogeneous and often unstructured data, in which the information provided is mainly through HTML and PDF formats. Although they seem to be the preferred formats to disclose data, they lack the machine-readability feature advocated by OGD. This concern is easily addressed with the use of current OGD portals which provide a straightforward manner to fully implement public openness with data; thus, government work processes should be redesigned to consider the OGD principles from data creation. However, some time will lag until cultural transformations make data really open. This paper proposes an architecture composed of a collaborative-oriented middleware for structuring information in the ""as is"" format while governments are prepared to fully comply with OGD. We describe all the main components through an implementation point of view.

Drawing on a multi-method approach, this paper develops a framework for identifying factors influencing the adoption of Open Government Data (OGD) by private organisations. Subsequently the framework was used to analyse five cases. The findings reveal that for private organizations to use OGD, the content and source of the data needs to be clear, a usable open data license must be present and continuity of data updates needs to be ensured. For none of the investigated private organisations OGD was key to their existence. Organisations use OGD in addition to, or as an enhancement of their core activities. As the official OGD-channels are bypassed trustworthy relationships between the data user and data provider were found to play an important role in finding and using OGD.

We think it is important that other public bodies, other than Empresa de Tecnologia e Informações da Previdência Social, become interested in analyzing and proposing changes and updates on classes whose theme contemplates the data managed by them.

"Carrasco C., Sobrepere X.",Open Government Data: An Assessment of the Spanish Municipal Situation,2015,Social Science Computer Review,24,"IESE Business School, University of Navarra, Barcelona, Spain","There is a growing quantity of data being generated in all aspects of our lives. Individuals and organizations produce and collect a broad range of different types of data in order to perform their tasks. Governments are particularly significant in this respect, not only because of the quantity and centrality of the data they collect, but also because most government data are public data by law and, therefore, could be made openly available for public use. Despite a growing consensus that Open Government in general and Open Data in particular are good both for governments and for society at large, there is no clear way to enable empirical analysis and quantitative measurements of Open Government Data initiatives. Our research uses a holistic approach proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that includes all stages in the deployment of an Open Government Data initiative, namely strategy, implementation, organization, communication, interaction, and Impact. The analysis shows that Spanish municipalities can be divided into three groups: municipalities that are performing reasonably well (A), municipalities that are doing something but not as much as the first group (B), and municipalities that are doing very little or almost nothing (C). The research also draws two basic similarities between groups A and B and two types of differences between them. Another conclusion is that the different dimensions explain partly (more than the 72% of the variance) the difference between actual and expected performances supporting indirectly the OECD’s framing and the probable existence of a pathway toward successful Open Government Data projects. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",local government; Open Data; Open Government; public policy evaluation; smart city,,"Carrasco, C.; IESE Business School, University of Navarra, Av.

Open data is an important initiative in this direction. A number of country data portals have come up in recent years. However continued flow of high quality, high value data is a challenge for many countries. To understand the challenges faced by government agencies in releasing their data in open, a large scale survey was carried across government agencies in India. Challenges discovered during the survey were grouped into five factors i.e. governance, resource constraint, capacity building, technology and lack of awareness using principal component factor analysis. Non-availability of adequate and appropriate resources to implement open data makes it difficult to generate high quality data on sustained basis. Institutionalization of open data in government is critical. Proper allocation of responsibility, mechanisms of accountability need to be set up through appropriate governance instruments. Lack of awareness about concept of open data and its potential use also poses hurdles for nodal officers driving the open data initiative in their departments. Capacity building of government officials is critical for enabling them to identify high value datasets, publishing in open domain. Technology can play an important role in making e-gov systems compliant with open data, generating high quality data and making the whole initiative sustainable. © 2015 ACM.","Challenges; Community engagement; Governance, capacity building; Institutionalization; Open government data; Platform",Government data processing; Principal component analysis; Surveys; Capacity building; Challenges; Community engagement; Institutionalization; Open government data; Platform; Open Data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The concept of Open Government Data (OGD) denotes the provision of public sector information, to make public data available for stakeholders to store, use, and redistribute without restriction or charge. Many initiatives worldwide have been undertaken to develop web portals facilitating access to public sector data. The aim of this chapter is to examine the growing implementation of OGD, analyzing the data disclosed by the central governments of the European Union (EU) member countries through their official OGD websites. The methodology used is based on four analytical approaches: functions, semantics, quality, and content. The results obtained show, first, considerable heterogeneity among EU portals and, second, that the implementation of OGD portals in Europe is at an intermediate level of development. At present, the results obtained suggest that the countries of the EU are making little use of the feedback possibilities offered by their portals and, in many, cases do not allow the introduction of new data. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",EU; E–government; Linked data; Metadata; Public Sector Information (PSI),,,English,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus

In particular, the influential factors and their impacts on open data initiatives are investigated from four perspectives: technology, organization, legislation and policy, and environment. Legislation and policy is found to have the most significant impact while agencies trade; existing regulations and policies act as constraints. The factors residing in organizational and environmental perspectives follow as the secondary impacts. Technological factors also exist but are considered to be relatively more easily resolved with sufficient support. While the identified factors act as determinants to influence government agencies trade; intentions towards open data participation, it is also found that open data is closely related to interagency information sharing, and the two activities in the long term are expected to reinforce to each other iteratively.

This paper seeks to make a contribution to reducing this gap. In order to do this, the concept of an open licence is first defined. Then, using a study of the extant literature and an examination of current open data licences, the challenges in designing an open data licence are explored. As part of this, relevant aspects of the debate that continue to surround such licensing in the worlds of open systems, freeware, shareware and open source are briefly discussed. A critique of a number of existing data licences including various international and national licencing frameworks is presented. The Creative Commons (CC) and Open Database (ODbL) Licenses are critically examined and problems with the concepts underlying a number of other licences are highlighted. The question of what may be suitable for standard public licenses and what may require bespoke or customised licensing is discussed. It is argued that many libertarian ideas about OGD licensing are unrealistic and that good licensing is critical to effective use of OGD. The paper concludes with a number of issues that would be designers of OGD licences need to address. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

Implementation of open government data initiatives is commonly supply-driven, as it is difficult to predict the possible uses and users of data. Nonetheless, the value of open data materializes only upon its use – either to achieve societal benefits or economic value. Design/methodology/approach – First, a list of organizational measures to facilitate open data use from the literature is collated. Then, four case studies to examine the challenges faced in practice when implementing them are carried out. The case sample includes two types of organizations (statistical agency and municipality) in two country settings (Sweden and The Netherlands). Findings – Public organizations find it challenging to set up support for open data users having various requirements and skills. Most public organizations have no or limited interaction with data users and are often selective with regards to with whom and how to communicate. Research limitations/implications – Given the fragmented and emerging state of research on open data use and engagement, to date no systematic framework existed which would be dedicated to user engagement strategies. The authors systematized the literature and identified the themes pertaining to this issue. Their contribution is a list of measures for public organizations to improve open data use. Practical implications – An important deliverable of this research is the list of possible organizational measures, which can be used by public managers to plan their open data engagement strategies. The authors suggest that data publishers adopt a problem-oriented approach for selecting which data to publish and put more efforts into stimulating stakeholder participation. Originality/value – The novelty of this study lies in the fact that it addresses a previously overlooked area of open data research, namely, the use of open data and ways to stimulate it. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Collaboration; Open (government) data; Open data engagement; Open data use; Organizational measures; Participation,,,English,Article,Final,Scopus

As well as this, the fact that they make considerable use of information technology, has led to the growth of their databases, and made governments and the respective government organizations, fertile ground for open data initiatives. Having access to budgetary data and being able to make use of it (with regard to revenue and expenditure), has traditionally always aroused great interest in society. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential benefits and possible obstacles that can affect the intermediaries who take action on the basis of budgetary data. A number of intermediaries (members of society and government policymakers) from four Latin-American countries were interviewed. The results show that the structural barriers of governments have an adverse effect on their activities because they impair the quality of the information that is made available. Nonetheless, the benefits that allow a greater degree of transparency as well as the ability to reveal more knowledge of the inside operations of governments, encourage the intermediaries to take part in this “ecosystem”. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",Benefits; Intermediaries; Obstacles; Open government data,Budget control; Electronic commerce; Information management; Information use; World Wide Web; Adverse effect; Benefits; Government organizations; Intermediaries; Latin americans; Obstacles; Open government data; Potential benefits; Big data,"da Silva Craveiro, G.; Universidade de São Paulo (USP)Brazil; email: giselesc@usp.br",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

This is done using a storytelling approach. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical data are based on a case study. The authors participated in, as well as followed, the process of realising an open government agenda on a local level, where citizens were invited to use open public data as the basis for developing apps and external Web solutions. Based on an interpretative tradition, they chose storytelling as a way to scrutinise the competition process. In this paper, they present a story about the competition process using the story elements put forward by Kendall and Kendall (2012). Findings - The research builds on existing research by proposing the myth that the “public” wants to make use of open data. The authors provide empirical insights into the challenge of gaining benefits from open public data. In particular, they illustrate the difficulties in getting citizens interested in using open public data. Their case shows that people seem to like the idea of open public data, but do not necessarily participate actively in the data reuse process. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on one empirical study. Further research is, therefore, needed. The authors would especially welcome more studies that focus on citizens’ interest and willingness to reuse open public data. Practical implications - This study illustrates the difficulties of promoting the reuse of open public data. Public organisations that want to pursue an open government agenda can use these findings as empirical insights. Originality/value - This paper answers the call for more empirical studies on public open data. Furthermore, it problematises the “myth” of public interest in the reuse of open public data. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Open government data (OGD); Open innovation; Open public data; Public data; Storytelling,,"Hellberg, A.-S.; Department of Informatics, Örebro UniversitySweden",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Murillo M.J.,Evaluating the role of online data availability: The case of economic and institutional transparency in sixteen Latin American nations,2015,International Political Science Review,15,"Notre Dame University, United States","We adopt the principal-agent framework and the asymmetry of information between the principal and the agent in order to approach two subjects of much attention and expectations: i) the formal online release of governmental data as a means of furnishing information, and ii) its contribution to government economic and institutional transparency. We identify important characteristics of transparency as instruments to lessen the information asymmetry in relevant areas (or subjects) where corruption and inefficiency are generally present in political institutions. We focus on the central governments of sixteen Latin American nations. We determine that, while there exists a moderate release of data relevant to areas where corruption generally takes place, its contribution to providing meaningful information to the citizenry is minimal. Our findings also show the importance of policy that explicitly mandates that data corresponding to specific areas where corruption and inefficiency take place be shared over the Internet; adequate levels of national online technical sophistication are not sufficient. We conclude that modern information technologies, as tools to contributing to government transparency and lessen knowledge divides in the evaluated areas, are not meeting expectations. Our framework and findings seek to utilize political science theories to contribute to an early understanding of the role of modern data-oriented technologies in government transparency, and highlight the positive and negative effects that these can have in the betterment of governance and the consolidation of democracy. © The Author(s) 2014.",corruption; e-Government; economic and institutional transparency; empowerment; open government data; publicity condition; transparency; transparency measurement,,"Murillo, M.J.; Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index, Notre Dame University, 1400 East Angela Boulevard, United States",English,Article,Final,Scopus

While politicians support data release and assume that the positive value of open data will dominate, many governmental organizations are reluctant to open their data, as they are afraid of the dark side. The objective of this paper is to provide a decision-making model that assists in trade-offs between the pros and cons of open data. Data disclosure is dependent on the type of data (e.g. its sensitivity, structure and quality) and the context (e.g. organizational policies, legislation and the political influences). Based on the literature and fifteen in-depth interviews with public sector officials and data archivists, this paper identifies contextual and dataset-related variables which influence a trade-off. A decision-making model is presented capturing trade-offs, and in this way providing guidance for weighing the creation of public value and the risks.

Yet, most OGD infrastructures do not support such activities. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the importance and usability of participation mechanisms and data quality indicators for open data infrastructures through quasi-experiments. A quasi-experiment is an experimental evaluation method in which researchers have control over the (non-random) assignment of participants to treatment and control conditions, the selection of control conditions and the organisation of the treatment, and over the measures. Moreover, quasi-experiments usually include a pre-test (i.e. a test before the treatment or control condition) and a post-test (i.e. a test after the treatment or control condition). The results of our quasi-experiments showed that the prototype of our OGD infrastructure improved OGD participation and data quality analysis by providing functionalities including discussion messages, social media sharing, linking items related to a dataset, Wiki descriptions and discussions, and data quality ratings and reviews. Participant observations showed that participants in the treatment group found it easier to conduct tasks with the prototype related to giving feedback on and discussing open data and rating and reviewing data quality than the participants in the control group. Our study suggested that participation mechanisms and quality indicators add value and improve the use of OGD. It recommends the implementation of such mechanisms and indicators in existing OGD infrastructures. To support the creation of transparency, citizen participation and innovation with OGD, our findings suggest that participation mechanisms and data quality indicators are a condition. Yet, these mechanisms and indicators are not sufficient for ensuring the generation of the OGD benefits, since there are still many factors which hinder the generation of these benefits. We discuss a number of these factors including factors related to OGD infrastructures and factors beyond OGD infrastructures. © The Authors, 2015.",Data quality; Experiments; Infrastructure; Open data; Participation; Social media; Usability,Data reduction; Experiments; Social networking (online); Data quality; Infrastructure; Open datum; Participation; Social media; Usability; Quality control,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

In addition to these technical tasks, persistent identifiers and their management are of prime concern for the governance of Domain Name System (DNS)-based domains containing output from multiple parties that need to ensure identifier uniqueness as their first order of operation. Our contribution to solutions for the technical and governance challenges posed by identity management is the PID Service - a persistent identity service - which is a web service offering advanced persistent identifier management with features not found in proxy servers and other web redirection products. The PID Service is able to store and implement large numbers of complex Uniform Resource Indicator (URI) redirection rules and handle related sets of rules according to rule hierarchies. This, combined with a web-based graphical user interface and database rule storage, allows users of the PID Service to far more easily manage large numbers of complex rules within a domain avoiding rule collision and specialised partial URI delegation. The Application Programming Interface allows programmatic access to all features of the service that, in turn, provides boundless integration possibilities with other applications and services. These possibilities include, but are not limited to, applications such as automatic data harvesting and digital entity identification. The PID Service is being used for a number of operational Semantic Web and Linked Data applications including the 'environment' portion of the Australian Commonwealth Government's data.gov.au project operating at environment.data.gov.au. There the PID Service handles the identifiers for a range of Linked Data products including the large and complex national Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric. In addition to handling current products within the domain, the design of the PID Service is such that it will be able to cope with large increases in number of persistent identifiers, which is important given the rising popularity of open government data and the use of services such as environment.data.gov.au. The PID Service has also formed part of the key service infrastructure in the Spatial Identifier Reference Framework (SIRF) (Atkinson et al., 2013) - a scalable linked data infrastructure that aims to improve the supply of open, spatially enabled and linked information. SIRF provides means to reliably cross-reference identifiers for the real-world locations and encodes spatial relationships between features (i.e. containment and adjacency). This framework of spatial identifiers is used to link together information (e.g., socio-economic statistics) about locations, stored in multiple distributed systems. In this paper we outline the motivation for the PID Service including the limitations of other proxy and redirect technologies. We provide an overview of the system design and describe both its technical functionalities and use cases. Finally, we describe the aforementioned installation of the PID Service at environment.data.gov.au and discuss how it impacts domain governance. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

Martin C.,Barriers to the open government data agenda: Taking a multi-level perspective,2014,Policy and Internet,60,"Department of Public Leadership and Social Enterprise, Open University Business School, United Kingdom","A loose coalition of advocates for Open Government Data (OGD) argue that such data has the potential to have a transformative impact by catalyzing innovation across sectors of the economy and by fostering democratic participation and engagement. However, there is limited evidence to date of the OGD agenda having such a transformative impact. This article applies the Multi-level Perspective (MLP); an approach more typically applied to study transitions to a sustainable society, to explore the nature of the barriers currently faced by the OGD agenda. It argues that such barriers exist in two forms: implementation barriers and barriers to use. The empirical results presented include survey responses measuring the perceptions of U.K. OGD community members of 33 barriers to the OGD data agenda. These results are analyzed to identify implications for OGD policy and practice. The article concludes with a start at establishing a theoretical grounding for the study of barriers to the OGD agenda. © 2014 Policy Studies Organization Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., 350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148, USA, and 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford, OX4 2DQ.",Barriers; Multi-level perspective; Open government data; Public sector innovation; Systems innovation; Technological transitions,,"Martin, C.; Department of Public Leadership and Social Enterprise, United Kingdom; email: chris.martin@open.ac.uk",English,Review,Final,Scopus

Furthermore, we discuss the value proposition of each business model archetype, and subsequently present a framework that describes the value created in the context of the open government data ecosystem. Our framework can be used by both scholars and practitioners in the field of open government data to effectively frame the debate of the value created by the commercial re-use of open government data.

Governments around the world have become ac-tive participants in this evolution, opening up their data for access and re-use by public and private agents alike. The phenomenon of Open Government Data has spread around the world in the last four years, driven by the widely held belief that use of Open Government Data has the ability to generate both economic and social value. However, a cursory review of the popular press, as well as an investigation of academic research and empirical data, reveals the need to further understand the relationship between Open Government Data and value.

A thematic analysis of interview, observational and policy documentation is presented which suggests that since 2010 the Open Government Data agenda has been used strategically by the UK's centre-right coalition government to progress a range of controversial policies, which are aimed at the continuation of the neoliberal form of state through its current crisis. Specifically, the relationship between Open Government Data policy and the neoliberal objectives of the marketisation of public services and privatisation of public assets, the leveraging of financial markets and the pharmaceutical industry, and the embedding of OGD into a broader agenda aimed at rebuilding trust in political elites are analysed.

However, most of the open government initiatives actually concern the provision of public data under an open license and in an open and accessible format. From a policy as well as from a research point of view, open government raises a set of questions about how to manage and evaluate their quality, also considering the compliance with enforced legal frameworks, if any available focused specifically on open government issues. Thus, the paper discusses a quality-based framework for open government data compliance assessment, made up of quality dimensions and a set of criteria contributing to the measurement of a compliance index.

"Graves A., Hendler J.",A study on the use of visualizations for Open Government Data,2014,Information Polity,15,"INRIA Chile, Santiago, Chile; Tetherless World Constellation, Department of Cognitive Science, Albany, NY, United States","In the last years, many government organizations have implemented Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives. The data published describe a broad set of areas, including environment, budget and education among others. While these initiatives often report anecdotal success regarding improved efficiency and governmental savings, the potential applications of OGD remain a largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we claim that there is an important group of people interested in OGD -e.g., journalists and activists- who could benefit from the use of OGD, but who cannot do so because they cannot perform the essential operations needed to collect, process, merge, and make sense of the data. The reasons behind these problems are multiple, the most critical one being a fundamental lack of expertise and technical knowledge related to data management and visualizations. We propose the use of visualizations as a way to alleviate this situation. Visualizations provide a simple mechanism to understand and communicate large amounts of data. We also show evidence that there is a need for exploratory mechanisms to navigate the data and metadata in these visualizations. Finally, we provide a discussion on a set of features that tools should have in order to facilitate the creation of visualizations by users. We briefly present the implementation of these features in a new tool prototype focused on simplifying the creation of visualization based on Open Data. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

The most recent trend is open government data (OGD), which includes data and information produced or commissioned by public bodies and data that can be freely used, re-used and distributed by anyone, subject to the requirement that users attribute the source and share their work as well. OGD promotes greater openness and accountability in government, strengthens democracy and drives innovation and economic opportunities for all people. More than 43 countries and 162 international regional organizations have implemented and operated OGD portals by 2013.

This system allows citizens to engage in debates using Open Government Data to enhance life and business. The debates must be directed toward evidence-based decision making because they have major effects on many citizens. These decisions require extensive debate, because the evidence will be different for each stakeholder. Therefore, we focus on the use of visual media because it provides a common language among stakeholders. To display the large volumes of visual media required by various stakeholders to facilitate debate using different forms of evidence, a large-scale display is required for presenting various types of content simultaneously. Thus, we develop an interactive display system with a touch screen interface and a smartphone controller to allow simultaneous operation by multiple users.

A core research question of this study is how to share cultural heritage data by using ontologies. A case study was conducted using open government data mapped with the CIDOC-CRM (Conceptual Reference Model). Twelve library- related files in unstructured data format were collected from an open government website, Seoul Metropolitan Government of Korea (http://data.seoul.go.kr). By using the ontologies of the CIDOC CRM 5.1.2, we conducted a mapping process as a way of enhancing cultural heritage information to share information as a data component. We graphed each file then mapped each file in tables. Implications of this study are both the enhanced discoverability of unstructured data and the reusability of mapped information. Issues emerging from this study involve verification of detail for complete compatibility without further input from domain experts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",Cultural heritage metadata models standards interoperability mappings and integration; Digital Curation workflows and models; Infrastructures for sharing content; Integration of intra or inter disciplinary heterogeneous resources; Ontologies and knowledge representation for the cultural heritage domain,Data curation; Government data processing; Information dissemination; Knowledge representation; Mapping; Metadata; Ontology; Reusability; Semantics; Cultural heritages; Heterogeneous resources; Infrastructures for sharing content; Metadata model; Work-flows; Open Data,"Park, H.; School of Information Studies, Northwest Quad Building B, 2025 E Newport, United States",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Brazil, as one of the eight founding countries, has implemented a series of actions to open its government. One of these key actions is its Access to Information Law. The Brazilian law established a legal framework of guidelines for opening data from all levels of government in the country, in addition to considering internet and transparency portals key elements for the consolidation of open government. In this scenario, local governments built websites dedicated to transparency without observing the law requirements and, consequently, Open Government Data (OGD) principles. This paper shows a comprehensive assessment of transparency websites through a survey with 20 municipalities. The Brazilian law requirements are used as evaluation criteria because they somehow cover OGD principles. Our results show a gap between local transparency portals and the effective implementation of the OGD principles. This gap leads to a misconception that transparency portals are dissociated from the open government initiative, which is not true.

Artigas F.,Spatial analytics for open government data,2014,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,"Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute, New Jersey Meadowlands Commission, 1 Dekorte Park Plaza, Lyndhurst NJ 07071, United States","Information from the Census is tied to a State, County or Township boundaries and is dated to when the information was collected. Similarly, water quality, electricity consumption, and sociolinguistic accents are tied to geography and dated to when they were measured. Any attribute that is spatially explicit can be explored using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is a tool to find relationships and visualize trends and patterns between datasets that share the same geography. Researchers may be familiar with GIS's visually appealing results and its analytical powers and may even have ideas on how to apply this tool to their own research questions but have never had the chance to actually use this tool to generate tangible results on their own. These compressed hands on tutorial exercises on spatial analytics for open government data are designed to expose participants to levels of complexity that build on each other and explore an increasing range of functionalities offered by modern GIS. As a result, participants walk away having experienced the entire cycle of spatial analysis from identifying and importing data, performing overlays for spatial analysis and preparing map layouts and presentations to communicate the findings. Through this tutorial, participants should gain a basic understanding and practice of GIS to utilize this tool and address research problems in their own fields of expertise.

"Srivastava V., Srivastava B.",Towards timely public health decisions to tackle seasonal diseases with open government data,2014,AAAI Workshop - Technical Report,2,"Freelance Analyst, India; IBM Research - India, India","Improving public health is a major responsibility of any government, and is of major interest to citizens and scientific communities around the world. Here, one sees two extremes. On one hand, tremendous progress has been made in recent years in the understanding of causes, spread and remedies of common and regularly occurring diseases like Dengue, Malaria and Japanese Encephalistis (JE). On the other hand, public agencies treat these diseases in an ad hoc manner without learning from the experiences of previous years. Specifically, they would get alerted once reported cases have already arisen substantially in the known disease season, reactively initiate a few actions and then document the disease impact (cases, deaths) for that period, only to forget this learning in the next season. However, they miss the opportunity to reduce preventable deaths and sickness, and their corresponding economic impact, which scientific progress could have enabled. The gap is universal but very prominent in developing countries like India. In this paper, we show that if public agencies provide historical disease impact information openly, it can be analyzed with statistical and machine learning techniques, correlated with best emerging practices in disease control, and simulated in a setting to optimize social benefits to provide timely guidance for new disease seasons and regions. We illustrate using open data for mosquito-borne communicable diseases; published results in public health on efficacy of Dengue control methods and apply it on a simulated typical city for maximal benefits with available resources. The exercise helps us further suggest strategies for new regions that may be anywhere in the world, how data could be better recorded by city agencies and what prevention methods should medical community focus on for wider impact. © Copyright 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaia.org).

Tamiami Trail, Sarasota, FL  SMC-C263, United States","The ability to predict future military engagements would be a boon to combatants, contracting companies, investors, and other stakeholders. While governments may seek to conceal plans for impending conflict, they must spend large sums of money mobilizing and equipping soldiers in preparation for deployment. Thus, examining government spending patterns might yield insight into future military conflict. This article reports on an attempt to explore the possibility of using open U.S. Department of Defense (D.O.D.) contracting data to identify patterns of spending activity that can predict future military engagement. The research in this article followed a two-stage method. The first stage involved the exploration of the research question in the context of a specific case, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The second stage assessed the open government contracting data used in the research and classified data and systems problems that were encountered according to an established analytical framework for open data barriers. The analysis demonstrated that the use of U.S. D.O.D. contracting data to predict future war has promise; however, a number of problems with the data and online portal prevented the derivation of conclusive, generalizable results. These problems were related to the open data barriers of task complexity and information quality. A detailed description of how these barriers manifested and directions for overcoming them are presented. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Case study; Data quality; Government portal; Military conflict; Open data; Research methods; System design,,"Whitmore, A.; Department of Information Systems and Decision Science, 8350 N.

Moreover, much of the existing research discusses benefits and disadvantages on a high level without providing much detailed insight in the underlying processes. Yet many governments are reluctant to open their data, as they are afraid of possible negative consequences of opening data. The objective of this policy paper is to better understand the aspects of the dark side of open data and contributes to the literature by providing a more realistic perspective on open data. We conducted nineteen in depth interviews with public sector officials and data archivists and identified sixteen categories of negative effects. For the dark side inherent to open data efforts the research suggests that a context and dataset dependent decision-making model needs to be made weighing the benefits of open data on the one hand (e.g. creating transparency, the possibility to strengthen economic growth), and the risks and disadvantages of open data (e.g. violating privacy and possible misuse and misinterpretation of data) on the other hand.

Historically, grey material was generated and used within an organisation. However, in recent years some research-relevant grey material is being made openly available. Among grey outputs, research datasets are the largest proportion by volume and increasingly these are being made openly available. It is necessary for users of grey material to have some indication of reliability (quality, context, availability) so that they can judge whether the grey material is appropriate to their requirements. Rich metadata provides a mechanism for such evaluation. CERIF (Common European Research Information Format) provides such a rich metadata environment. Furthermore, CERIF allows generation of discovery level metadata (such as DC (Dublin Core), DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary), CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) for simple retrieval or browsing and provides navigation to more detailed and specific metadata about the grey object.

As a consequence, numerous collections of RDF data are published, going from scientific data to general-purpose ontologies to open government data, in particular published as part of the Linked Data movement. Managing such large volumes of RDF data is challenging, due to the sheer size, the heterogeneity, and the further complexity brought by RDF reasoning. To tackle the size challenge, distributed storage architectures are required. Cloud computing is an emerging distributed paradigm massively adopted in many applications for the scalability, faulttolerance and elasticity features it provides.

Such initiatives aim to improve transparency of public entities and to enhance accountability of public officials towards ordinary citizens. However, these initiatives raise several questions, namely: Which data should be disclosed? How to bring together dispersed (fragmented) data disclosed through several different portals? How to improve the understandability by ordinary citizens of the data disclosed? The goal of this paper is to define and propose a transparency ontology that might help to provide an answer to these questions, thus filling the gaps in this research area. The proposed ontology seeks to adopt the perspective of the ordinary citizen in what concerns public entities’ transparency and accountability. Therefore, the process of ontology definition started by identifying relevant themes/terms discussed in the media (newspapers) considering the role of journalists as ‘information brokers’.

Here, the city acts as an urban innovation ecosystem in which smart applications, open government data and new modes of participation are fostering innovation in the city. However, detailed analyses on how to manage smart city initiatives as well as descriptions of underlying challenges and barriers seem still scarce. Therefore, this paper investigates four, collaborative smart city initiatives in Europe to learn how cities can optimize the citizen's involvement in the context of open innovation. The analytical framework focuses on the innovation ecosystem and the civic capacities to engage in the public domain. Findings show that public service delivery can be co-designed between the city and citizens, if different toolkits aligned with the specific capacities and skills of the users are provided.

Canares M.P.,Opening the local: Full disclosure policy and its impact on local governments in the Philippines,2014,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,7,"Step Up Consulting Services, 3 Genaro Visarra Street, Tagbilaran City, 6300, Philippines","In 2011, the Philippine government required local government units (LGUs) to post financial and procurement-related information in LGU websites. This research investigates whether this initiative has affected both the providers of the information and its supposed audience - the public, as represented by citizen groups. To answer the questions, the researchers made use of a case study approach by selecting three provinces as research sites which yielded two major findings. On the supply side, incentivising openness is a critical aspect in ensuring that local governments have the interest to disclose financial data. However, on the demand side, there is limited awareness on the part of the public, and more particularly the intermediaries (e.g. business groups, civil society organizations, research institutions), on the availability of data, and thus, its limited use. This paper argues that openness is not just about governments putting meaningful government data out into the public domain, but also about making the public meaningfully engage with governments. This requires policies that will require observance of open government data standards and a capacity building process of ensuring that the public, to whom the data is intended, are aware and able to use the data in ensuring more transparent and accountable governance.

Although governments create large amounts of data, the publication of open data is often cumbersome and there are no standard procedures and processes for opening data, blocking the easy publication of government data. Design/methodology/approach: Action design research (ADR) was used to derive design principles. The literature was used as a foundation, and discussion sessions with civil servants were used to evaluate the usefulness of the principles. Findings: Barriers preventing easy and low-cost publication of open data were identified and connected to design principles, which can be used to guide the design of an open data publishing process. Five new principles are: start thinking about the opening of data at the beginning of the process; develop guidelines, especially about privacy and policy sensitivity of data; provide decision support by integrating insight in the activities of other actors involved in the publishing process; make data publication an integral, well-defined and standardized part of daily procedures and routines; and monitor how the published data are reused. Research limitations/implications: The principles are derived using ADR in a single case. A next step can be to investigate multiple comparative case studies and detail the principles further. We recommend using these principles to develop a reference architecture. Practical implications: The design principles can be used by public organizations to improve their open data publishing processes. The design principles are derived from practice and discussed with practitioners. The discussions showed that the principles could improve the publication process. Social implications: Decreasing the barriers for publishing open government data could result in the publication of more open data. These open data can then be used to stimulate various public values, such as transparency, accountability, innovation, economic growth and informed decision- and policymaking. Originality/value: Publishing data by public organizations is a complex and ill-understood activity. The lack of suitable business processes and the unclear division of responsibilities block publication of open data.

While the value generated by OGD has been widely discussed by public bodies and other stakeholders, little attention has been paid to this phenomenon in the academic literature. Hence, we developed a conceptual model portraying how data as a resource can be transformed to value. We show the causal relationships between four contextual, enabling factors, four types of value generation mechanisms and value. We use empirical data from 61 countries to test these relationships, using the PLS method. The results mostly support the hypothesized relationships. Our conclusion is that if openness is complemented with resource governance, capabilities in society and technical connectivity, use of OGD will stimulate the generation of economic and social value through four different archetypical mechanisms: Efficiency, Innovation, Transparency and Participation. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.",Economic value; Open government data; Openness; Public sector information; Social value; Value generating mechanisms,Economic values; Generating mechanism; Open government data; Openness; Public sector information; Social values; Hardware; Information systems,"Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, Denmark",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Since the late 2000s numerous international organizations, inter-governmental bodies and governments have issued open government data policies, which set out key principles underpinning access to, and the release and reuse of data. These policies reiterate the value of government data and establish the default position that it should be openly accessible to the public under transparent and non-discriminatory conditions, which are conducive to innovative reuse of the data. A key principle stated in open government data policies is that legal rights in government information must be exercised in a manner that is consistent with and supports the open accessibility and reusability of the data. In particular, where government information and data is protected by copyright, access should be provided under licensing terms which clearly permit its reuse and dissemination. This principle has been further developed in the policies issued by Australian Governments into a specific requirement that Government agencies are to apply the Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY) as the default licensing position when releasing government information and data. A wide-ranging survey of the practices of Australian Government agencies in managing their information and data, commissioned by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in 2012, provides valuable insights into progress towards the achievement of open government policy objectives and the adoption of open licensing practices. The survey results indicate that Australian Government agencies are embracing open access and a proactive disclosure culture and that open licensing under Creative Commons licences is increasingly prevalent. However, the finding that ""[t]he default position of open access licensing is not clearly or robustly stated, nor properly reflected in the practice of Government agencies? points to the need to further develop the policy framework and the principles governing information access and reuse, and to provide practical guidance tools on open licensing if the broadest range of government information and data is to be made available for innovative reuse.

Thanks to the semantic extension, queries to the geo-catalogue are expanded with domain specific terms taken from the ontology thus obtaining a higher number of relevant documents in output.

"Graves A., Hendler J.",Visualization tools for Open Government Data,2013,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,39,"Tetherless World Constellation, Department of Cognitive Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, United States","In recent years many government organizations have implemented Open Government Data (OGD) policies to make their data publicly available. This data usually covers a broad set of domains, from financial to ecological information. While these initiatives often report anecdotal success regarding improved efficiency and governmental savings, the potential applications of OGD remain a largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we claim that there is an important portion of the population who could benefit from the use of OGD, but who cannot do so because they cannot perform the essential operations needed to collect, process, merge, and make sense of the data. The reasons behind these problems are multiple, the most critical one being a fundamental lack of expertise and technical knowledge. We propose the use of visualizations as a way to alleviate this situation. Visualizations provide a simple mechanism to understand and communicate large amounts of data. We also show evidence that there is a need for exploratory mechanisms to navigate the data and metadata in these visualizations. Finally, we provide a discussion on a set of features that tools should have in order to facilitate the creation of visualizations by users.

The outcomes are three classification schemes developed by using the creativity technique of morphological boxes: one for the strategic and two for the operational dimension. This classification is grounded in the results of a multiple case study analysis and relevant literature. The classification schemes provide a structured overview of the characteristics which have to be considered when implementing and operating an OGD portal.

Governments around the world have become active participants in this evolution by opening up their data for access and re-use by public and private agents alike. The recent phenomenon of Open Government Data (OGD) has spread around the world, driven by the proposition that opening government data has the ability to generate both economic and social value. However, a review of the academic research and the popular press reveals only sporadic attention given to various aspects with no overarching framework that explains how OGD generates value. We apply a critical realist approach to uncover the generative mechanisms that serve to explain this relationship. First, we present a strategic framework with four archetypical generative mechanisms. The framework outlines the different pathways to value generation and highlights the current tension between the private/public and economic/social domains. Second, we offer a conceptual model that provides a systematic way of articulating and examining further the generation of value from OGD.",Big data; Generative mechanisms; Open access; Open government data; Value creation,Information systems; Academic research; Generative mechanism; Global connectivity; Growing production; Open Access; Open government data; Strategic frameworks; Value creation; Big data,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

The evaluation framework is based on findings of previous research on the evaluation of public projects, information systems and e-services, and also on technology acceptance and IS success models. The proposed evaluation framework consists of an evaluation model with measurable evaluation dimensions and criteria, as well as a comprehensive evaluation procedure for using this evaluation model, which enables both higher level and detailed evaluation. It includes quantitative as well as qualitative methods in order to provide comprehensive and deep insights. Finally, we describe an application of the proposed framework (both the model and the procedure) for the evaluation of a European e-infrastructure for opening government data.

This is unlike previous approaches of e-government service innovation where services are solely initiated and developed by the agencies themselves. However, despite public agencies actively promoting the use of their data by organizing events such as challenge competitions, the response from external stakeholders to leverage government data for innovative activities has been lacking. This raises the question about the reasons inhibiting the interest to innovate using open data. Yet, the existing literature points to a lack of understanding about external stakeholders’ willingness to innovate with the data provided.

In addition, in the literature of reusing public sector information to create added values, several challenges are identified to have negative impact on the value chain formation. By employing the six dimensions of open data policy, the research argues that the movement of OGD can strengthen the value chain creation of reusing government information and data, and the challenges as discussed in the literature are expected to be alleviated.

This provides business organisations with the opportunity to acquire large datasets in order to offer novel information services or to better market existing products and services. Much of this data is now publicly available (e.g., thanks to initiatives such as Open Government Data). The challenge from a corporate perspective is to make sense of the third party data and transform it so that it can more easily integrate with their existing corporate data or with datasets with a different provenance. This paper presents research-in-progress aimed at semantically transforming raw data on U.K. registered companies. The approach adopted is based on BORO (a 4D foundational ontology and re-engineering method) and the target technological platform is Neo4J (a graph database). The primary challenges encountered are (1) re-engineering the raw data into a 4D ontology and (2) representing the 4D ontology into a graph database.

This policy covers a wide range of government datasets, from core reference data and regularly collected performance indicators, to one-off research commissioned to support policy making. In arguments for open data, government datasets are commonly treated as if they are pre-existing artifacts waiting to be transferred from their current locations locked away on government hard drives, to public availability on websites and data-portals. However, in practice, many datasets are constructed in the process of being opened: whether as combinations of source material, or as derivative extracts of internal data systems. In this short paper we present a brief case study of one instance of open data release, focusing on a dataset related to the 'Digital Landscape Research' published in 2012 alongside a new Government Digital Strategy. We explore different factors influencing how the data came to be published, and question whether a simple call for 'raw data' best serves the cause of promoting data re-use.

Spatio-relational DBMSs are used to implement geographic information systems (GIS) and are fit to manage large amounts of data and geographic objects such as points, lines, polygons, etc. In this paper, we extend the Description Logic DL-Lite with spatial objects and show how to answer spatial conjunctive queries (SCQs) over ontologies-that is, conjunctive queries with point-set topological relations such as next and within-expressed in this language. The goal of this extension is to enable an off-the-shelf use of spatio-relational DBMSs to answer SCQs using rewriting techniques, where data sources and geographic objects are stored in a database and spatial conjunctive queries are rewritten to SQL statements with spatial functions. Furthermore, we consider keyword-based querying over spatial OBDA data sources, and show how to map queries expressed as simple keyword lists describing objects of interest to SCQs, using a meta-model for completing the SCQs with spatial aspects. We have implemented our lightweight approach to spatial OBDA in a prototype and show initial experimental results using data sources such as Open Street Maps and Open Government Data Vienna from an associated project. We show that for real-world scenarios, practical queries are expressible under meta-model completion, and that query answering is computationally feasible. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Big data; Data description; Information management; Ontology; Query languages; Semantic Web; Topology; Conjunctive queries; Description logic; Geographic objects; Large amounts of data; Ontology-based data access; Real-world scenario; Spatial functions; Topological relations; Query processing,,English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus
Elbadawi I.A.,The state of open government data in GCC countries,2012,"Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Government, ECEG",8,"Emirates eGovernment, Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Three countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) (i.e. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE)) have launched official Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives and started offering public data openly on their national portals. These initiatives are part of a new phase of the eGovernment programs in these three countries. This case study explores and compares the current status of these initiatives in an effort to understand the key driving forces behind launching the initiatives, the countries' approach to launching and managing them, the major challenges facing them and their plans to overcome them, and their future plans for sustaining and improving their open data initiatives. We also use data from interviews with the government officials in charge of these initiatives in Saudi Arabia and UAE to evaluate how these countries perceive the Open Government Partnership (OGP) as an example of a key global OGD initiative. Our analysis showed similarities in the countries' motivations to open up their governments, driven by the potential economic returns. We found that the current status of these countries' OGD portals (in terms of richness of the published data and its strategic value) does not match the desired standards. Although the studied countries follow different approaches in managing their OGD initiatives, they face the common challenge of poor cooperation between government agencies, which is mainly caused by cultural barriers, variations in agencies' readiness, a lack of necessary policies and legislation, and uncertainties about the value of OGD for these agencies. To overcome these challenges, and to improve and sustain the OGD initiatives over the long term, we offer the following specific recommendations: develop a national OGD strategy to align OGD activities with the overall national agenda, build a framework that clearly defines the major components of OGD, such as the roles and responsibilities of government agencies and other stakeholders, and all aspects related to data gathering and publishing on the portals. We also recommend building up an open data community across government and non-government sectors to act as a platform for exchanging OGD knowledge and practices. In addition, we recommend expending more effort to fill the legislation gap, adopt and adapt international practices, and promote continuous learning and development.",Bahrain; eGovernment; Open government data; Saudi Arabia; UAE,Bahrain; e-Government; Open government data; Saudi Arabia; UAE; Developing countries; Digital storage; Knowledge management; Government data processing,"Elbadawi, I.A.; Emirates eGovernment, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; email: Ibrahim.elbadawi@gmail.com",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

This logic, drawn from previous literature and past studies, is extended by examining the interplay between economic benefits of e-Government and social considerations in adoption of e-Government models decisions. Drawing on organizational decision-making research, this research argues that, both early and late adopters respond to framing and interpreting adoption decision situations as opportunities, instead of threats, to enhance transparency and accountability. Following interpretivist research conventions methodology, the sampling plan was purposeful and included a total of 39 interviews. It is found that the social, political, and economic context of developing countries may not readily accommodate current models of openness in e-Government. The conclusion drawn in this research is that motivations for the openness in e-Government to appear legitimate coexist with motivations to realize transparency and accountability. These findings prompt rethinking of the classic institutional, framing, and diffusion model, to suggest openness in e-Government model that developing countries could adopt to suit their social and economic context, as a contribution to the body of knowledge. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,Solusi UniversityZimbabwe,English,Book Chapter,Final,Scopus

Although Linked Data design has promise for integrating world wide data, integrators often struggle to provide appropriate transparency for their sources and transformations. Without this transparency, cautious consumers are unlikely to find enough information to allow them to trust third party content. While capturing provenance in RPI's Linking Open Government Data project, we were faced with the common problem that only a portion of provenance that is captured is effectively used. Using our water quality portal's use case as an example, we argue that one key to enabling provenance use is a better treatment of provenance granularity. To address this challenge, we have designed an approach that supports deriving abstracted provenance from granular provenance in an open environment.

However, this information is publicly accessible and users cannot control how to disclose their personal information. Protecting personal information is deemed important in use cases such as controlling access to sensitive personal information on the Social Semantic Web or even in Linked Open Government Data. The Privacy Preference Ontology (PPO) can be used to define fine-grained privacy preferences to control access to personal information and the Privacy Preference Manager (PPM) can be used to enforce such preferences to determine which specific parts of information can be granted access. However, PPO and PPM require further extensions to create more control when granting access to sensitive data; such as more flexible granularity for defining privacy preferences. In this paper, we (1) extend PPO with new classes and properties to define further finegrained privacy preferences; (2) provide a new light-weight vocabulary, called the Privacy Preference Manager Ontology (PPMO), to define characteristics about privacy preference managers; and (3) present an extension to PPM to enable further control when publishing and sharing personal information based on the extended PPO and the new vocabulary PPMO.

This platform requires a step-based method to deal with the requirements of the public procurement sector and the open government data initiative: (1) modeling the unstructured information included in public procurement notices (contracting authorities, organizations, contracts awarded, etc.); (2) enriching that information with the existing product classification systems and the linked data vocabularies; (3) publishing relevant information extracted out of the notices following the linking open data approach; (4) implementing enhanced services based on advanced algorithms and techniques like query expansion methods to exploit the information in a semantic way. Taking into account that public procurement notices contain different kinds of data like types of contract, region, duration, total amount, target enterprise, etc., various methods can be applied to expand user queries easing the access to the information and providing a more accurate information retrieval system. Nevertheless expanded user queries can involve an extra-time in the process of retrieving notices. That is why a performance evaluation is outlined to tune up the semantic methods and the generated queries providing a scalable and time-efficient system. Moreover, this platform is supposed to be especially relevant for SMEs that want to tender in the European Union (EU), easing their access to the information of the notices and fostering their participation in cross-border public procurement processes across Europe. Finally an example of use is provided to evaluate and compare the goodness and the improvement of the proposed platform with regard to the existing ones. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",commercial services; e-government; e-Procurement; linked open data; semantic technologies,Commercial services; e-Government; e-Procurement; linked open data; Semantic technologies; Artificial intelligence; Software engineering; Search engines,"Alvarez, J.M.; Department of Computer Science, Calvo Sotelo St. S/N, Oviedo, Asturias 33007, Spain; email: josem.alvarez@weso.es",English,Article,Final,Scopus

These disciplines bring diverse theoretical and methodological approaches, providing alternative perspectives and insight into Web activity. Consequently, Web Science faces the challenge of developing research methods that transcend disciplines, not least in dealing with the epistemological tensions between different methodological approaches. As a start, this paper argues that, a mixed methods approach is required. To demonstrate the affordances of this, the activities of the UK Open Government Data community are analyzed by combining quantitative computational science techniques with qualitative social science methods underpinned by social theory. This provides a richer and more detailed analysis than either approach alone could offer and one which enables us to apprehend the Web as a complex socio-technical phenomenon.

Recently, Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives emerged worldwide aiming to make public data freely available to everyone, without limiting restrictions. Despite its potential however there is currently a lack of roadmaps, guidelines and benchmarking frameworks to drive and measure OGD progress. This is particularly true as proposed stage models for measuring eGovernment progress focus on services and do not sufficiently consider data. In this paper, we capitalize on literature on eGovernment stage models and OGD initiatives to propose a stage model for OGD. The proposed model has two main dimensions, namely organizational & technological complexity and added value for data consumers. We anticipate the proposed model will open up a scientific discussion on OGD stage models and will be used by practitioners for constructing roadmaps and for benchmarking just like the European Union stage model is currently used for measuring public service online sophistication. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",data integration; eGovernment; open data; Stage model,Added values; Added-value services; Data integration; eGovernment; European Union; open data; Primary materials; Public data; Public sector information; Public services; Road-maps; Stage model; Stage models; Technological complexity; Added-value services; e-Government; Online sophistications; Open datum; Primary materials; Public sector information; Stage models; Technological complexity; Benchmarking; Benchmarking; Digital storage; Government data processing; Government data processing; Data integration,"Kalampokis, E.; Informatics and Telematics Institute, , Hellas, Greece; email: ekal@uom.gr",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

These early endeavors seem to present some essential limitations related mainly to scalability and uptake. In order to avoid these limitations, we introduce a two-phased approach for supporting participatory decision-making based on the integration and analysis of social and government open data. The proposed approach is based on the literature related to the analysis of massive amounts of social data for future events prediction. In this paper we also present a Web data driven architecture for the implementation of the proposed approach. The architecture is based on the use of linked data paradigm as a layer that will enable integration of data from different sources. We anticipate that the proposed approach will (i) allow decision makers to understand and predict public opinion and reaction about specific decisions; and (ii) enable citizens to inadvertently contribute in decision-making. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Data driven architecture; eParticipation; Linked data; Open government data; Social data,Data-driven architectures; E-participation; Linked datum; Open government data; Social data; Architecture; User interfaces; Decision making,"Kalampokis, E.; Digital Enterprise Research Institute, , Galway, Ireland; email: Evangelos.Kalampokis@deri.org",English,Conference Paper,Final,Scopus

Janssen K.,The role of public sector information in the European market for online content: A never-ending story or a new beginning?,2011,Info,9,"Interdisciplinary Centre for Law and ICT, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Purpose: This paper aims to address the recent trends and developments relating to the re-use of public sector information (PSI) and open government data. Design/methodology/approach: It starts from the European Commission's Digital Agenda, which stressed the importance of opening up access to content to promote the single market. While the 2003 PSI directive has contributed to this, barriers to the re-use of PSI still remain, often based on a lack of awareness with public sector data holders and users. Some of these barriers are currently being challenged by the open government data (OGD) movement. While this movement has comparable objectives to the PSI directive, it is based on different arguments. This raises the question of how the two approaches relate. Findings: The paper argues that the proponents of the re-use of PSI and OGD should join forces to promote the availability of public sector data. Originality/value: In this way, the public sector can be encouraged to rethink its information policy and move to a more coherent view on how data can be used to increase the benefits for the information society and the market for digital content. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Access; European Union; Information; Open government data; Public sector information; Re-use,,"Janssen, K.; Interdisciplinary Centre for Law and ICT, , Leuven, Belgium; email: katleen.janssen@law.kuleuven.be",English,Article,Final,Scopus

Multiple design choices had to be made and are discussed. Important features are stemming during tokenization, including bigrams into the word cloud and multilingualism. Also, the original parsimonious language models were extended with an additional term dampening unigrams that already occurred in the word cloud. This algorithm was tested in a small user study, using proceedings of the University of Amsterdam Science faculty's student council. Members of this council had to give their preference for multiple word clouds constructed using either parsimonious language models or simple Term Frequencies (TF) with stop words. 68% over 29% (p #60; 0.05, two-tailed paired t-test) preferred the word clouds constructed using parsimonious language models.

With the launch of data.gov.uk the UK Government has been finding out. This paper sets out the case for using Linked Data standards for publishing open government data and describes some of the benefits. It explains how Linked Data standards uniquely allow governments to publish data responsibly and why responsible data publishing is so important to the open government data movement. The paper goes on to explain how the Linked Data world was not quite ready for the large-scale adoption of these standards by a major government, leaving much to be done to develop practical approaches and patterns for the publishing of government data. From URIs, to provenance and versioning, through to statistics and geographic information, much thinking and work has been done. In each case the emphasis has been, not on research, but designing simple repeatable patterns, supported through tools. This work has also involved and building understanding and capability amongst officials from across government departments and agencies. It explains why the government's use of linked data standards was not universally welcomed and was even greeted by antagonism from some. Learning from this feedback the paper describes how we are now using linked data standards to enable government as a platform, commoditising the process of creating APIs to meet the needs of a wide range of data consumers, from business, academia and the developer communities.
